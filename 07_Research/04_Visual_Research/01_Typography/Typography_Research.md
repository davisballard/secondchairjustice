# Second Chair: Typography Research
### The Canonical Typefaces of Legal Prestige, 1986–1995

**Research Scope:** Primary visual territory research for the 1986–1995 legal prestige aesthetic — the typefaces that actually appeared in legal documents, law firm materials, institutional publications, and adjacent prestige communications during this period. Not typefaces that "feel" legal. Typefaces that *were* legal.

**Research Method:** Wikipedia historical records, Fonts In Use archive, Typography for Lawyers (Matthew Butterick), Design Observer critical writing, U.S. Court of Appeals Seventh Circuit brief guidelines, and cross-referenced institutional usage documentation.

**Status:** Draft — ready for moodboard cross-reference

## HOW TO READ THIS DOCUMENT

Each typeface entry covers:
1. **Origin and designer** — the specific history that gives the face its authority
2. **Visual anatomy** — precise description of proportions, x-height, stroke contrast, serif structure, weight distribution
3. **Documented institutional uses, 1986–1995** — where it actually appeared
4. **Why it communicates authority** — the specific mechanisms, not vague impressions
5. **How to distinguish it from surface-similar faces** — costume vs. authentic
6. **Modern acquisition** — where to get the correct digital version today
7. **Second Chair relevance rating** — Track 1 (aesthetic territory) or Track 2 (distinctive asset candidate)

## THE BRIEF'S TYPEFACE HIERARCHY

The Visual Research Brief (VISUAL_RESEARCH_BRIEF.md) identified these as the canonical faces of the era. This document confirms, complicates, or refines those identifications with research:

| Brief's Designation | Status After Research | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Century Schoolbook | **Confirmed — primary** | More specific claim than the brief suggests: SCOTUS mandated it in writing |
| Caslon (Adobe Caslon) | **Confirmed — institutional** | The founding document face; institutional authority runs deeper than expected |
| ITC Garamond | **Confirmed but complex** | The era's most ubiquitous prestige serif — and deeply contested by designers |
| Adobe Garamond | **Confirmed as the correct version** | What institutions *wanted* when they wanted Garamond |
| Palatino | **Confirmed — court-recommended** | Specifically cited by federal courts as appropriate for legal briefs |
| Times New Roman | **Confirmed — with important caveat** | Courts explicitly told lawyers to stop using it by the mid-1990s |
| Bodoni (ITC Bodoni) | **Confirmed display only** | High-contrast thick/thin used at headline sizes in publications |
| Trajan | **Partially confirmed** | More 1990s display than active legal use; film titles more than documents |

One addition not in the brief: **Bookman Old Style** — the institutional workhorse that predates Century, appears in late-era legal publishing, and deserves documentation.

## TYPEFACE 1: CENTURY SCHOOLBOOK

### The Most Important Typeface in American Law

**Second Chair Relevance: TRACK 2 — Primary Distinctive Asset Candidate**

---

### Origin and Designer

Century Schoolbook was designed by **Morris Fuller Benton** in **1919** for **American Type Founders (ATF)**, at the request of educational publisher Ginn & Company, who needed a face legible enough for children learning to read. The face belongs to the Century family, which begins with **Linn Boyd Benton's** Century Roman of 1894 — designed for *The Century Magazine* at the request of printer Theodore Low De Vinne, who believed contemporary typefaces had become "effeminate" through excessive refinement.

The Century family traces its lineage to the **Scotch Roman** tradition — Scottish type design from Edinburgh's William Miller foundry in the early 19th century, itself part of the **Didone** genus (high contrast between thick and thin strokes, bracketed serifs, vertical stress axis). Century Schoolbook is thus the twentieth-century American interpretation of nineteenth-century British institutional typography.

Morris Fuller Benton based the design on **Clark University legibility research** showing that young readers most rapidly identified letterforms with high contrast between thick and thin strokes, provided the thinner strokes retained presence. Counter-form research (the white space within and around letters) showed that open counters at small sizes dramatically improved recognition speed. Benton's response: enlarged x-height, widened counters, increased overall stroke weight. The face released in 1918–1923 in regular, italic, and bold.

---

### Visual Anatomy

**X-height:** Tall — substantially taller than Garamond or Caslon. This is the defining characteristic. The lowercase letters are large relative to the capitals, producing pages of dense text that read as surprisingly open.

**Proportions:** Wide — not condensed. The letters have a generous, confident horizontal spread. This creates longer line lengths per word and an overall feeling of solidity rather than elegance.

**Stroke contrast:** Moderate to high. The thick vertical strokes are substantially heavier than the thin horizontal strokes, but the thins do not disappear at small sizes as they do in Bodoni. The contrast is designed to survive imperfect printing — which is why it works as well in a Xeroxed court brief as in a carefully typeset law review.

**Serifs:** Flat, bracketed, moderately thick. Not the elegant thin serifs of Garamond. Not the slab serifs of Rockwell. A middle position: the serifs have weight but do not dominate the letterform. They help the eye track across the baseline without interrupting the stroke rhythm.

**Ball terminals:** Distinctive. The lowercase letters c, f, j, r, and the figures 2, 3, 5, 6, 9 all terminate in small circular ball terminals rather than simple cuts. This creates a recurring circular accent that gives Century its slightly bookish personality compared to the colder rationalism of later digital faces.

**Capital letters:** More regular and slightly lighter than the lowercase in apparent weight — the typical issue with Century's capitals noted by Frederic Goudy, who disliked the "spotty" page it could produce when capitals appeared frequently.

**Italic:** Upright-leaning — the italic is less dramatically slanted than Garamond or Caslon italics. It functions more as a companion than a distinct voice, which suits legal documents where italic serves citation and emphasis rather than expression.

**Weight distribution:** Slightly bottom-heavy. The thick vertical strokes tend to have slightly more weight at the foot than the head, which contributes to the typeface's stable, grounded feeling.

---

### Documented Legal Institutional Uses, 1986–1995

**U.S. Supreme Court (documented, mandatory):** The Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States (2019 edition, reflecting practices established decades earlier) specify in writing: *"The text of every booklet-format document, including any appendix thereto, shall be typeset in a Century family (e.g., Century Expanded, New Century Schoolbook, or Century Schoolbook) 12-point type with 2-point or more leading between lines."* This mandate was in practice throughout the 1986–1995 period. Every brief filed before the Supreme Court was set in Century.

**Office of the Solicitor General (documented):** The Seventh Circuit's brief guidelines explicitly cite the Solicitor General's briefs as a model: *"Both the Supreme Court and the Solicitor General use Century, a variant of Century Schoolbook."* The Solicitor General represents the United States before the Supreme Court — the most prestigious legal filings in the country were set in Century.

**U.S. Supreme Court published opinions:** The Supreme Court's own published opinions — the *United States Reports* — are set in Century Schoolbook. Every published SCOTUS opinion from this era appeared in this typeface.

**Law school casebooks:** Century Schoolbook was the dominant typeface for American legal education through this period. West Publishing, Foundation Press, and Little Brown all produced casebooks in Century or New Century Schoolbook. A PI attorney who attended law school between 1980 and 1995 learned the law in this typeface.

**Federal appellate courts:** By the mid-1990s, federal courts were explicitly recommending Century over Times New Roman in their submission guidelines, based on legibility research. The Seventh Circuit's publicly available guidance (the source document quoted in this research) identified Century as the standard.

---

### Why It Communicates Authority

Century Schoolbook communicates authority through **institutional ubiquity made legible**. Unlike Garamond, whose authority is aristocratic and scholarly, Century's authority is governmental and institutional. It is the typeface of the Supreme Court. That is not metaphor — it is documented fact.

The large x-height and generous proportions also communicate something specific: **this is type designed to be read, not to be admired.** The face does not congratulate itself on its elegance. It puts the content first. In legal contexts, that communicates exactly the right thing: the argument matters more than its presentation.

The ball terminals add a personality detail — a slight warmth, a slight humanity — that prevents Century from reading as cold or corporate. It reads instead as **institutional but principled** — the way a judge reads, not the way a salesman presents.

---

### Costume vs. Authentic

**The costume error:** Using a contemporary geometric serif (Freight Text, Tisa, Tiempos) and calling it "Century-inspired." These faces lack the specific visual signatures: ball terminals, the particular x-height ratio, the confident horizontal proportions. They read as "book typography" without the specific coding of legal institutional typography.

**The subtler costume error:** Using ITC Century rather than Century Schoolbook. ITC Century (designed for photocomposition in the 1970s) has an even more aggressively enlarged x-height and different proportions — it was designed for advertising, not documents. It looks like Century the way a publicist looks like a lawyer: dressed similarly, oriented differently.

**The most common authentic version available digitally:** Monotype's Century Schoolbook, which is bundled with many Microsoft products — this is what courts and attorneys actually used during the desktop publishing transition of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Not ideal for display use at large sizes, but historically accurate.

---

### Modern Acquisition

**For authentic use:**
- **Monotype Century Schoolbook** — The standard version. Available through Fonts.com and Monotype's own catalog. The most historically accurate digital version for text setting.
- **New Century Schoolbook (URW++)** — A Ghostscript-included open-source version; close but slightly different proportions.
- **Century Supra (Matthew Butterick, Typography for Lawyers)** — A premium redesign specifically for legal documents, narrower and darker than the original. Explicitly designed for legal pleadings by an attorney-turned-type-designer.
- **ITC Century** — Available widely; note the significant x-height difference from Century Schoolbook. Use at display sizes where the legibility research optimizations of Schoolbook are less relevant.

---

## TYPEFACE 2: CASLON (ADOBE CASLON)

### The Founding Document Face — English Legal Tradition

**Second Chair Relevance: TRACK 2 — Body Text System Candidate**

---

### Origin and Designer

Caslon was designed by **William Caslon I** (1692–1766) in London, beginning approximately 1725. Caslon began his career engraving ornamental designs on firearms before being recruited by prominent London printers who recognized his precision. He studied and was influenced by Dutch Baroque typefaces popular in England — particularly the Amsterdam work of Dirck Voskens — but produced work distinctly his own: warmer, more English in character, with slightly more variation across sizes.

Caslon's achievement was establishing the first significant English tradition of type design. Before his work, English printers imported type from Holland. His specimen sheet, dated 1734 but issued from 1738, became an international document — and his types were distributed throughout the British Empire, including British North America. The **U.S. Declaration of Independence** was set in Caslon type by printer John Dunlap in 1776. This is the origin point of Caslon's particular authority in American institutional design: it is literally the typeface of the American founding.

The modern **Adobe Caslon** revival was designed by **Carol Twombly** in **1990**, based on Caslon's own specimen pages printed between 1734 and 1770. It is a member of the **Adobe Originals** program — one of the earliest and most prestigious digital typeface commissions — and added extensive professional typographic features: small caps, old-style figures, swash letters, ligatures, alternate characters, fractions, and matching ornaments.

---

### Visual Anatomy

**Classification:** Old-style (Garalde). This is critical to understanding how Caslon differs from Century or Garamond.

**X-height:** Moderate — lower than Century Schoolbook, higher than traditional Garamond. The ascenders and descenders are relatively short, but the lowercase letters have reasonable presence.

**Proportions:** Slightly condensed compared to Century. Not narrow, but not expansive. Caslon sets more characters per line than Century at the same point size.

**Stroke contrast:** Modest in body text sizes. The contrast between thick and thin strokes is present but not dramatic — less than Garamond, far less than Bodoni. Caslon's contrast increases at display sizes.

**Axis:** Diagonal — the stress axis (the line through the thinnest points of a curved letter) runs at an angle, like a broad-nib pen held at roughly 30 degrees. This pen-like origin distinguishes old-style faces from transitional or modern faces, where the axis becomes more upright.

**Serifs:** Angled entry strokes with modest bracketing. Not the flat mechanically-precise serifs of Century. The serif entries have a slight pen-drawn quality — they meet the main stroke at an angle rather than horizontally.

**Key identifying letterforms:**
- The lowercase **a** has a slight ball terminal
- The capital **A** has a concave hollow at top left
- The capital **G** has no downward-pointing spur at bottom right
- The capital **M** has straight sides (not splayed)
- The capital **W** has three terminals at the top
- The italic **h** folds inward (the bowl points inward rather than continuing to the baseline)
- The italic uses flourishes on **Q, T, v, w, z** in original versions (not all revivals)

**Weight distribution:** Even — the face is designed for comfortable extended reading without visual excitement. William Berkson (designer of Williams Caslon Text) describes Caslon in body text as "comfortable and inviting."

**Italic:** More dramatic than Century's italic but less sharp than Garamond's. Caslon's italic leans noticeably and has genuine personality — it functions as a distinct voice rather than a slight variation on the roman.

---

### Documented Legal Institutional Uses, 1986–1995

**University of Virginia and University of Southern California:** Adobe Caslon is one of the two official typefaces of both universities — both institutions with serious law schools. This reflects Caslon's general institutional prestige in American education and legal academia.

**The New Yorker:** Adobe Caslon is used for body text in *The New Yorker*, where it appeared continuously through this period. The New Yorker audience is precisely the aspiration profile of the attorneys Second Chair targets — educated, discerning, skeptical of marketing.

**Law firm letterhead and stationery:** Caslon was widely used in high-prestige law firm communications during this era. The "When in doubt, use Caslon" dictum circulated in professional printing circles precisely because of this usage.

**Federal court brief guidance:** The Seventh Circuit's published brief guidelines explicitly name Caslon as a preferred typeface for legal submissions: *"The judges also like Baskerville, Bembo, Caslon, Deepdene, Galliard, Jenson, Minion, Palatino, Pontifex, Stone Serif, Trump Mediæval, and Utopia, all of which were designed for use in books."* This is documented federal court guidance actively circulating in the legal profession during this period.

**Historical foundational uses:** The U.S. Declaration of Independence, the colonial Bible, the founding-era legal and political literature of the American republic. This isn't decorative history — it creates genuine semantic weight for an American institutional audience.

---

### Why It Communicates Authority

Caslon communicates authority through **deep provenance and democratic tradition**. Unlike the aristocratic refinement of Garamond (French court typography) or the institutional mandate of Century (Supreme Court rules), Caslon's authority is republican: it is the typeface of self-governance, of founding documents, of American constitutional tradition.

For a PI attorney — someone who genuinely believes in access to justice, who often frames their practice around the democratizing function of tort law — Caslon carries the right kind of authority. It is not the authority of inherited privilege but of written principle.

The old-style construction also communicates something specific: **this type was not designed for machines.** The diagonal axis, the pen-drawn serifs, the variation across sizes — these are traces of the human hand at the origin of the letterform. That humanist quality is precisely what distinguishes legal document typography from corporate typography.

---

### Costume vs. Authentic

**The common costume error:** Using any face with "Caslon" in the name without knowing which Caslon. There are at least a dozen digital versions with dramatically different characteristics. Caslon 224 (designed by Ed Benguiat for ITC) is an advertising face — heavy, aggressive, designed for print ads, not documents. Caslon 540 (ATF's shortened-descender version) is a photocomposition adaptation with different proportions. ITC Founder's Caslon (Justin Howes) adds intentional distress appropriate for historical reproduction but not for contemporary institutional use.

**The correct version for Second Chair's purposes:** **Adobe Caslon Pro (Carol Twombly, 1990)** — specifically designed for book and document setting, with the full professional feature set (small caps, old-style figures, swash alternates). This is the version that communicates institution rather than antiquarianism.

**The most important typographic detail:** In legal and institutional contexts, Caslon should be used with **old-style figures** (text figures that rise and fall with the lowercase letters rather than sitting on the baseline at capital height). Lining figures (modern numerals all at cap height) read as contemporary, commercial, post-1970s typesetting. Old-style figures read as book typography, as institution, as something that predates the spreadsheet.

---

### Modern Acquisition

- **Adobe Caslon Pro** — Available through Adobe Fonts (included with Creative Cloud) and separately through MyFonts. The standard reference.
- **LTC Caslon (P22/Lanston Type Company, 2005)** — Based on the Lanston Type Company's 1915 14-point version, considered extremely faithful to the original. More historically precise than Adobe Caslon.
- **Williams Caslon Text (Font Bureau, 2010)** — A modern interpretation by William Berkson, heavier weight to compensate for contemporary printing, bold included. Currently used by *Foreign Affairs*.
- **Big Caslon (Matthew Carter, 1994)** — Specifically designed for display sizes (18pt and above), based on Caslon's largest sizes which had dramatically more contrast and personality than his text sizes. Bundled with macOS. Use this for headlines and display applications, Adobe Caslon for body text.

## TYPEFACE 3: ITC GARAMOND

### The Era's Most Ubiquitous Prestige Serif — and Its Problems

**Second Chair Relevance: TRACK 1 — Aesthetic Territory (understand but do not use as primary)**

---

### Origin and Designer

ITC Garamond was designed by **Tony Stan** in **1975** for the **International Typeface Corporation (ITC)**, released that year alongside ITC Century and ITC Cheltenham as a family intended to address "the shortage of ultra weight typefaces in the text type size ranges." The family initially included Ultra and Book weights; Light and Bold followed in 1977 along with a full range of Condensed styles; Narrow styles were added in 1991.

ITC (International Typeface Corporation) was founded in 1970 by Herb Lubalin, Aaron Burns, and Ed Rondthaler specifically to provide typeface licensing to the phototypesetting industry — the technology that dominated professional typesetting from approximately 1965 to 1985, when digital typesetting (PostScript, Linotronic) gradually replaced it. ITC's business model was to create design-rights-protected typeface families and license them broadly to phototypesetting machine manufacturers. The consequence: ITC faces were available everywhere from every phototypesetting house, and in towns with only one typesetter, ITC Garamond *was* Garamond.

The relationship to Claude Garamond (c. 1510–1561) is complex and disputed. Most "Garamond" typefaces available through the 20th century were actually based on the work of **Jean Jannon**, a French Protestant printer who released his own typefaces in 1621, 60 years after Garamond's death, in the Garamond/Granjon style. Jannon's matrices were misattributed to Garamond in the 19th century. ITC Garamond does not particularly resemble either Garamond or Jannon — it is Tony Stan's interpretation of the Garamond genre, redesigned to accommodate the technical requirements and aesthetic preferences of the phototypesetting era.

---

### Visual Anatomy

**Defining characteristic:** **Enormous lowercase x-height.** This is the single most visually distinctive feature of ITC Garamond — the lowercase letters are dramatically taller relative to the capitals than in any historical Garamond. In Michael Bierut's 2004 essay "I Hate ITC Garamond" (Design Observer), he writes: "The most distinctive element of the typeface is its enormous lower-case x-height. In theory this improves its legibility, but only in the same way that dog poop's creamy consistency in theory should make it more edible."

This x-height decision was driven by ITC's design philosophy: ITC systematically enlarged the x-height of all its typefaces to improve legibility in phototypesetting reproduction (which tended to lose fine detail at body sizes). The side effect was to give ITC typefaces a visual character distinctly different from their historical models.

**Proportions:** Generous but slightly condensed in the text weights. The Condensed versions (widely used in advertising and headlines) compress significantly further — to approximately 64% of normal width.

**Stroke contrast:** Moderate. Less contrast than original Garamond/Jannon, slightly more than Century. The thins are maintained at body sizes.

**Axis:** Transitional — between old-style diagonal and transitional near-vertical. Not as pen-derived as Caslon or Garamond, not as geometric as Century.

**Italic:** Pronounced slant, quite ornate in the original design. The italic has character but does not particularly resemble any historical Garamond italic.

---

### Documented Historical Uses, 1986–1995

**Apple Computer (1984–2002):** The most significant single deployment in this aesthetic territory. Apple commissioned Bitstream to modify ITC Garamond for use as Apple's corporate typeface in preparation for the 1984 Macintosh launch. Apple condensed ITC Garamond to 80% of its normal width (the existing ITC Garamond Condensed at 64% was deemed too narrow). The resulting face, known as **Apple Garamond**, appeared on every Apple product package, advertisement, and communication for approximately 18 years.

**Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982):** Documented on Fonts In Use — ITC Garamond was used in the official typography of Canada's constitutional document, designed by BB&H/Robert Herrera and George Baynes.

**Kinko's (1992):** Also documented — ITC Garamond appeared in Kinko's advertising and logo materials.

**General corporate identity (pervasive):** American Express, Goldman Sachs adjacent-brands, management consulting firms, financial institutions, and prestige publishers used ITC Garamond or Garamond-adjacent faces extensively in this period. The Garamond genus was the dominant prestige serif of corporate identity, 1975–1995.

**Annual reports and capabilities brochures:** The combination of ITC Garamond or similar Garamond faces with navy blue, cream, and burgundy palettes defined the visual language of corporate prestige communications through this era. This is the core aesthetic territory.

---

### Why It Communicates Authority — and Why It Doesn't

ITC Garamond communicates authority through **genre association** rather than through any intrinsic quality of its letterforms. The Garamond name carries enormous prestige — Claude Garamond's roman type from 16th century France is genuinely one of the great achievements of Western typography. ITC Garamond borrows that prestige while offering a face significantly different from Garamond's actual work.

The issue is that ITC Garamond's enormous x-height, which was designed for advertising and phototypesetting efficiency, gives the face a slightly **inflated, overenthusiastic quality** — it lacks the quiet confidence of type designed to hold its own over long passages of book text. Paula Scher, in a famous 1987 debate, denounced ITC Garamond for the simple reason that "it's called Garamond and it's not Garamond."

**For Second Chair's purposes:** ITC Garamond is authentic to the aesthetic territory (it was genuinely everywhere in the 1986–1995 period), but it is not the best choice for a brand seeking to signal deep typographic knowledge. A brand that knows the difference between ITC Garamond and Adobe Garamond — and demonstrates that knowledge through its own typography — communicates something that a brand merely using ITC Garamond cannot.

**The exception:** ITC Garamond Condensed at display sizes (headlines, subheads, pull quotes) is genuinely arresting and was widely used in this way. It communicates "serious publication from this era" with immediacy. For intentional period-specific effect, the Condensed at display sizes has legitimate applications.

---

### Modern Acquisition

## TYPEFACE 4: ADOBE GARAMOND (& MONOTYPE GARAMOND)

### What Institutions Wanted When They Wanted Garamond

**Second Chair Relevance: TRACK 1 — Primary Aesthetic Territory, Secondary Candidate for Pairing**

---

### Origin and Designer

**Adobe Garamond** was designed by **Robert Slimbach** in **1989** — the first year of the Adobe Originals program — based on direct study of Claude Garamond's original punches and matrices preserved at the **Plantin-Moretus Museum** in Antwerp. Slimbach traveled to Antwerp specifically to study these surviving objects, producing a revival considered by typographers to be among the most historically faithful to Garamond's actual work.

The italic of Adobe Garamond is based on **Robert Granjon's** italic designs — Granjon was Garamond's contemporary and produced the most widely admired italics of the Renaissance period. This is actually authentic to Renaissance practice: printers of the 16th century routinely paired Garamond's romans with Granjon's italics because Garamond's own italics were considered inferior.

**Monotype Garamond** (1922), the most common version available throughout the 1986–1995 period in professional typesetting, is actually based on Jannon's matrices — not Garamond's. This is documented: the matrices at the Imprimerie nationale in Paris were labeled "Caractères de l'Université" in the 19th century and mistakenly attributed to Garamond, when they were in fact Jannon's work from 1621. Monotype Garamond is thus technically a Jannon revival — with Jannon's distinctively triangular scooped serifs on the tops of n, m, r and his more ornate italic. Monotype Garamond is bundled with Microsoft Office and was the most widely distributed "Garamond" in the era.

---

### Visual Anatomy — True Garamond vs. Jannon

The distinction matters for understanding what you're looking at:

**True Garamond characteristics (Adobe Garamond):**
- Lowercase **e** has a very small eye (the enclosed white space) and a nearly horizontal crossbar
- The bowl of the lowercase **a** has a sharp turn at top left
- **X-height:** Very low at larger sizes — the lowercase letters are relatively small compared to the capitals and ascenders, giving the page a more spacious, scholarly feeling
- **Ascenders:** Long and elegant, rising well above the cap height
- **Stroke contrast:** Limited but present — the thins are maintained at text sizes
- **Axis:** Diagonal — pen-derived, humanist
- **Capital R:** The leg extends outward from the letter in a characteristic gesture
- **Capital M:** Slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top

**Jannon characteristics (Monotype Garamond — the most common version in the era):**
- Scooped-out triangular serifs on the tops of **n, m, r** — more dramatic than Garamond's
- The italic is more ornate and has more variation in angle than Granjon's italics
- Slightly more condensed overall

**For Second Chair research purposes:** Both versions appeared in the aesthetic territory, but their emotional registers differ. Adobe Garamond (true Garamond characteristics) reads as more scholarly, more precise, more trustworthy to a trained typographic eye. Monotype Garamond (Jannon) reads as slightly more decorative and period-specific — it has more of the phototypesetting era's character.

---

### Documented Institutional Uses, 1986–1995

Garamond (in various versions) was the dominant prestige serif of American corporate and institutional identity through this entire period. Specific documented uses:

**Academic publishing:** University presses including Harvard, Princeton, and Yale used Garamond-family typefaces for their books through this period. Academic monographs in law, political science, and economics were routinely set in Garamond.

**Corporate identity:** American Express used Garamond (ITC Garamond) as its primary corporate typeface. Goldman Sachs's annual reports and materials used Garamond-adjacent faces. The McKinsey document aesthetic referenced in the VISUAL_RESEARCH_BRIEF.md was Garamond-based.

**Annual reports:** Garamond was the dominant body text face in prestige annual reports, 1975–1995. Its elegant proportions and traditional heritage communicated exactly the right combination of seriousness and refinement for institutional investor communications.

**Advertising — The New Yorker pages:** The advertisements that appeared in *The New Yorker* during 1986–1994 — the prestige lifestyle advertising that defines the aspiration profile of the target attorney — were heavily Garamond. Patek Philippe, JPMorgan Private Bank, luxury goods and financial services all used Garamond or Garamond-adjacent faces in this context.

---

### Why It Communicates Authority

Adobe Garamond (true Garamond) communicates authority through **scholarly restraint and Renaissance provenance**. The low x-height creates pages with long, elegant ascenders and generous white space — the page breathes. The limited stroke contrast means the type is never demanding attention; it recedes into the service of the argument. This is exactly what the Seventh Circuit's brief guidelines mean when they recommend typefaces "designed for books": books don't want you to notice the type.

The historical depth matters psychologically. Claude Garamond's types were used by the French royal press, by Robert Estienne for the New Testament, by printers across Europe for 200 years. That heritage is legible to trained eyes, even without being named. Type designers call this **quality without announcement**.

---

### Costume vs. Authentic

**Common error:** Using any "Garamond" without knowing which one. Cormorant Garamond (Catharsis Fonts, 2014) is a beautiful contemporary display revival — it reads as contemporary luxury typography, not as legal institutional typography. Sabon (Hermann Zapf, 1964/1967) is a "Garamond for the 20th century" designed for mechanical composition — it reads as slightly more regularized and controlled than Adobe Garamond but is authentic to the era.

**The correct question:** Does this Garamond have a low x-height, long ascenders, diagonal axis, and subtle stroke contrast? If yes, it is reading as scholarly old-style. If it has a tall x-height and more horizontal axis, it is reading as a phototypesetting-era face (ITC genre), which is authentic to the period but not to the scholarly layer of it.

---

### Modern Acquisition

- **Adobe Garamond Pro** — Available through Adobe Fonts (included in Creative Cloud). The standard professional reference. Small caps, old-style figures, swash alternates.
- **Sabon (Linotype)** — Hermann Zapf's 1964 design for mechanical composition, based closely on Garamond with some regularizations. Widely used in book typography. Available through MyFonts.
- **EB Garamond (Georg Duffner, open source)** — Free, based on the Egenolff-Berner specimen (which shows Garamond's actual types). Good for reference and development; license appropriate for web use.
- **Cormorant Garamond** — Contemporary revival; appropriate for display at large sizes; note the different character from institutional use.

---

## TYPEFACE 5: PALATINO

### Herman Zapf's Masterwork — The Preferred Alternative

**Second Chair Relevance: TRACK 1 — Aesthetic Territory, Elevated Alternative to Times**

---

### Origin and Designer

Palatino was designed by **Hermann Zapf** and released by **Stempel** in **1948–1950**. It is named after the Italian Renaissance master calligrapher Giambattista Palatino and belongs to the **Humanist** classification of serif typefaces — which, like old-style faces, trace their letterform origins to Renaissance calligraphy, but with slightly more regularized proportions and stroke contrast.

Zapf was one of the most important type designers of the twentieth century, and Palatino is widely considered his most successful text face. The design was based on Zapf's own study of humanist calligraphy from the Italian Renaissance — he was himself a skilled calligrapher, and the calligraphic origins of Palatino are legible in its letterforms in ways that ITC Garamond's calligraphic origins are not.

---

### Visual Anatomy

**X-height:** Moderate — higher than Garamond, lower than Century Schoolbook. Palatino occupies a balanced middle position.

**Proportions:** Slightly broad — the letters have a confident horizontal spread similar to Caslon.

**Stroke contrast:** Moderate — more than Caslon, less than Bodoni. The calligraphic origin shows in the organic quality of the stroke transitions.

**Serifs:** Slightly flared, with gentle bracketing. Palatino's serifs have a quality sometimes described as "calligraphically sharpened" — they suggest the natural tapering of a broad nib pen rather than the mechanical precision of a cut steel punch.

**Axis:** Near-diagonal — retaining the humanist pen-held-at-an-angle character but more upright than purely old-style faces like Caslon.

**Distinctive quality:** Palatino has a slightly larger-than-average apparent size at any given point size, due to its proportions. It sets more densely than it appears — making it efficient for document use.

### Documented Legal Institutional Uses, 1986–1995

**Federal court recommendations (explicit):** The Seventh Circuit's brief guidelines name Palatino as one of the preferred typefaces: *"The judges also like Baskerville, Bembo, Caslon, Deepdene, Galliard, Jenson, Minion, Palatino, Pontifex, Stone Serif, Trump Mediæval, and Utopia."*

**System font distribution:** Palatino was included as a standard LaserWriter font in Apple's PostScript printer driver beginning in 1985 — making it one of the first high-quality book-typeface-caliber fonts available to desktop publishers. This means it appeared extensively in the late-1980s desktop publishing era in prestige communications that could afford a PostScript output device.

**Academic and professional publishing:** Palatino's combination of elegance, readability, and moderate x-height made it widely used in university press publications, annual reports, and legal briefs during the DTP transition period (1985–1993).

---

### Why It Communicates Authority

Palatino communicates authority through **legible craft**. Unlike ITC Garamond, which borrowed Garamond's prestige without fully embodying his values, Palatino was designed with genuine calligraphic knowledge and shows it. The letterforms have a natural organic quality that communicates that they were drawn, not mechanically derived.

For legal documents specifically, Palatino has the key quality identified by courts: it was designed for books, and it reads like a book. Wide measures (full page-width paragraphs as used in legal briefs) suit Palatino's proportions better than they suit Times New Roman's.

---

### Costume vs. Authentic

**Common issue:** Palatino has been free or bundled with system software since the late 1980s, and as a result it carries some association with "default DTP typography" — the same file that produced Palatino headers also defaulted to Palatino for the church bulletin or the school newsletter. The face itself is not the problem; the application is.

**The correct application for Second Chair:** Used at appropriate sizes with careful spacing (Palatino rewards manual optical kerning more than some other faces), set with proper leading (at least 120% of point size), on cream or laid paper stock, Palatino reads as an educated professional's choice. Used carelessly, it reads as Microsoft Word's forgotten brother.

---

### Modern Acquisition

- **Palatino Linotype** — The Microsoft-bundled version; widely available.
- **Hermann Zapf's Palatino Nova (Linotype)** — A later refinement by Zapf himself, with improved hinting and additional features. The preferred version for serious use.
- **TeX Gyre Pagella** — Open-source version based on URW Palladio; appropriate for digital/web use.
- **Aldus (Stempel/Linotype)** — A companion face Zapf designed specifically for text setting at smaller sizes; more refined than Palatino at 10–12pt.

## TYPEFACE 6: TIMES NEW ROMAN

### The Default — and Why Courts Said Stop

**Second Chair Relevance: TRACK 1 — Ubiquity reference; explicitly NOT a Track 2 candidate**

---

### Origin and Designer

Times New Roman was designed in **1929–1932** by **Stanley Morison** (conception and supervision) with drawing executed by **Victor Lardent**, an advertising artist at *The Times* of London. Morison was the typographic advisor to Monotype and had been brought in by *The Times* to improve the newspaper's typography — at the time considered surprisingly poor for one of the world's most authoritative publications.

The design brief was specific: a typeface for newspaper printing that would be **economical** (setting more characters per line than existing faces), **legible** at small sizes in poor printing conditions, and **authoritative** in the visual tradition of established serif typefaces. Morison based the design on experiments with Perpetua and Plantin, incorporating Caslon-era proportions with some modernist regularization.

Times New Roman first appeared in *The Times* on October 3, 1932. Morison licensed it to Monotype and Linotype almost immediately, and its adoption as a broadly distributed type led directly to its dominance: **it was one of the first fonts available for every new typesetting technology**, including digital typesetting and then personal computers. Microsoft bundled it with Windows from the early 1990s.

---

### Visual Anatomy

**X-height:** Moderate — lower than Century Schoolbook, roughly comparable to Palatino.

**Proportions:** Narrow. This is the most critical visual characteristic. Times was designed for the narrow column widths of a newspaper. Its letters are slightly condensed compared to book typefaces, allowing more characters per line in the same physical space.

**Stroke contrast:** High — notably higher than Caslon or Garamond. The thick/thin transition is crisp and pronounced, contributing to the face's sharp, efficient appearance.

**Serifs:** Flat, bracketed, thin — particularly the horizontal hairline serifs. These thin serifs are part of what makes Times look slightly **fragile or mean** in wide-measure documents: they were designed to survive newspaper printing's low-resolution ink spread, and they were designed to work in narrow columns where the eye returns frequently to the left margin. In a legal brief with 1.5-inch margins, they look like they're doing the wrong job.

**The italic:** Considered below average by typographic standards — narrower and less distinctive than the roman. Not Morison's finest work.

---

### Documented Legal Institutional Uses, 1986–1995

**Pervasive default:** Times New Roman's dominance was not chosen — it was defaulted into. As Microsoft Windows spread through the legal profession (lawyers were among the earliest heavy adopters of word processing), Times New Roman was the default word-processing font. Legal briefs, memos, contracts, and letters were set in Times New Roman because that's what WordPerfect and then Microsoft Word shipped with.

**U.S. State Department:** Times New Roman was adopted as the official U.S. State Department typeface, reflecting the default institutional adoption of the face across government.

**Explicit court rejection:** By the mid-1990s, federal courts were *actively discouraging* Times New Roman in legal submissions. The Seventh Circuit's brief guidelines state: *"Avoid using Times New Roman. It was designed for newspapers, which are printed in narrow columns, and has a small x-height in order to squeeze extra characters into the narrow columns. It functions well in this use, but not when columns are wide (as in briefs and other submissions)."*

---

### What Times Communicates

**The problem:** Times New Roman communicates **default** — it communicates that no typographic decision was made. A brief set in Times New Roman says "my secretary knows how to use Word." A brief set in Century Schoolbook says "I know what the Supreme Court uses and I chose it deliberately."

This distinction is exactly why Times New Roman is aesthetically omnipresent in the 1986–1995 legal world but should not be a Second Chair distinctive asset candidate. Using Times would communicate that Second Chair occupies the default zone — which is precisely what the Visual Research Brief is trying to escape.

**Track 1 use:** Times New Roman is essential to understand as *what the target attorney has been looking at for 30 years* — it is the typography of the legal profession's daily paper, the wallpaper of the legal world. Second Chair should communicate contrast with this default without naming it.

## TYPEFACE 7: BODONI (ITC BODONI / ATF BODONI)

### The Display Voice — Extreme Contrast as Institution

**Second Chair Relevance: TRACK 1 — Display/Masthead application only**

---

### Origin and Designer

Bodoni's eponymous typeface was developed by **Giambattista Bodoni** (1740–1813), printer to the Duke of Parma, released in complete form in his *Manuale Tipografico* (1818, posthumous). Bodoni represents the extreme end of the **Didone** classification — the movement in late 18th century type design toward maximum rationalization and contrast between thick and thin strokes, maximum verticality of stress axis, and perfectly mechanically-precise hairline serifs.

The relationship to the **Century family** is direct: Century was designed to replace the overly refined Didone faces that had made common printing difficult to read. Bodoni's extreme contrast, which is beautiful at display sizes, collapses at body text sizes — the hairline serifs disappear in low-resolution printing conditions. Century was designed specifically to solve this problem.

**ITC Bodoni** (1994) was a revival project coordinated by ITC with multiple designers working simultaneously on versions at different optical sizes — Janice Fishman, Holly Goldsmith, Jim Parkinson, and Sumner Stone each produced a distinct size-optimized version. This is the most commonly available digital Bodoni.

---

### Visual Anatomy

**Defining characteristic:** **Extreme thick/thin contrast.** The thick vertical strokes are very heavy; the thin horizontal strokes are hairlines. The difference is the most extreme of any typeface family in common use.

**Axis:** Perfectly vertical. Unlike Caslon or Garamond (diagonal, pen-derived), Bodoni's axis is a mechanical vertical — this typeface announces that it was designed by a geometer, not a calligrapher.

**Serifs:** Perfectly flat and horizontal, with no bracketing. The serifs are hairlines — the same weight as the thin strokes. They attach to the main stroke at exactly 90 degrees.

**Proportions:** Upright, moderately wide. The capitals in particular have an impressive formal bearing.

**The visual effect:** At display sizes (24pt and above), Bodoni creates extreme visual drama — the contrast is theatrical. At body text sizes, the hairlines disappear and the face becomes difficult to read. This is not a body text face.

---

### Documented Legal Institutional Uses, 1986–1995

**Publication mastheads:** *The American Lawyer*, *Fortune*, *Forbes* — prestige institutional publications of the era used Bodoni-family faces for their display mastheads and section headers. The masthead of *The American Lawyer* during this period is a direct reference for Second Chair.

**Financial advertising:** Bodoni or Bodoni-adjacent faces appeared in financial advertising — the extreme contrast communicates precision, authority, and the sense that every detail has been considered.

**Annual report headings:** Used at large sizes for section dividers, company names, and headline text in prestige annual reports.

**Not in body text:** Bodoni in body text is a diagnostic marker of amateur typesetting or fashion-oriented design (it was used extensively in luxury fashion advertising). No serious legal document of the era used Bodoni for body text.

---

### The Thick/Thin Principle for Second Chair

Bodoni is useful as a *reference* for understanding the thick/thin contrast that runs through the entire aesthetic territory — from Bodoni's extreme version through Century's moderate version through Garamond's subtle version. The level of contrast in a typeface communicates something: Bodoni says *theater*; Century says *institution*; Garamond says *scholarship*. Choosing the right position on this spectrum is part of the typographic decision.

---

### Modern Acquisition

- **ITC Bodoni** (1994 revival by Fishman, Goldsmith, Parkinson, Stone) — Available through MyFonts; includes size-specific versions (Six, Twelve, Seventy-Two) optimized for different uses
- **Hoefler & Co. Hoefler Text's built-in figures** — Hoefler Text incorporates Bodoni-derived display elements in some applications
- **Bauer Bodoni (Bauer Type Foundry)** — The historical reference version; available through Linotype/Monotype; slightly different characteristics from ITC

---

## TYPEFACE 8: BOOKMAN OLD STYLE

### The Institutional Workhorse — Pre-Century Authority

**Second Chair Relevance: TRACK 1 — Historical reference; context for Century's authority**

---

### Origin and Designer

**Bookman** traces its origin to **Alexander Phemister's Old Style** typeface of 1869, designed for Edinburgh's Miller & Richard foundry. American Type Founders released their version as **Bookman Old Style**, which became extremely popular. The face belongs to the same broad Old Style classification as Caslon, but with a significantly enlarged x-height and heavier overall weight — it is sometimes described as Caslon with its proportions boosted toward legibility.

**ITC Bookman** (1975) was designed by **Ed Benguiat** — the same designer who later produced ITC Garamond 223/224. Like all ITC faces of the era, ITC Bookman enlarged the x-height further and added advertising-weight bolds.

---

### Visual Anatomy

**Defining characteristics:** Large x-height, heavy overall weight, subtle stroke contrast (much less than Bodoni, comparable to or slightly more than Caslon). Bookman's letterforms have a **robust, heavy-footed quality** — the serifs are particularly thick and the overall color of a page set in Bookman is noticeably darker than Caslon or Garamond.

**The result:** Bookman reads as **solid, reliable, slightly old-fashioned in a respectable way.** Not elegant, not refined — authoritative in the way a well-worn leather chair is authoritative.

---

### Documented Institutional Uses, 1986–1995

Bookman appeared extensively in legal publishing through the mid-20th century and continued in use through the early desktop publishing era. Its heavy weight and large x-height make it particularly legible in small print — it appeared in directory-style publications, reference works, and legal forms where dense text needed to remain readable.

Century Schoolbook essentially displaced Bookman as the prestige legal text face beginning in the 1970s when photocomposition made more refined options available. By 1986, Bookman was the secondary option — chosen when Century wasn't available or when slightly heavier color was desired.

**Notable modern use:** *The New Yorker* was set in Caslon, but its close competitor Bookman appeared in comparable institutional contexts. Foreign Affairs magazine historically used Bookman-adjacent faces.

## THE TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM BEYOND THE INDIVIDUAL TYPEFACE

The Visual Research Brief identifies several structural typographic conventions that defined the aesthetic as much as the typefaces themselves. This research confirms and extends those observations:

### Small Caps for Firm Names and Section Headers

Small caps — capital letters drawn at approximately x-height, with slightly modified proportions — appeared consistently in legal document headers, firm names, running heads, and section designations. The effect: institutional identity without typographic aggression. **SECOND CHAIR** in small caps reads as established. **SECOND CHAIR** in full-size caps reads as shouting. **Second Chair** in mixed case reads as contemporary commercial.

The distinction is legible to anyone who has read law review articles or legal briefs — which is everyone in the target audience. Small caps are not decorative; they are a precision signal of knowing the conventions.

**Requirement:** Small caps must come from the typeface's actual small cap characters (included in OpenType professional font packages like Adobe Caslon Pro). Fake small caps — generated by scaling down capital letters — look visibly different (thinner strokes, slightly different weight) and communicate that the designer didn't have or didn't use the real font. For Second Chair's purposes: only true small caps.

### Leading (Line Spacing) — Generous, Never Compressed

Legal documents breathed. Generous leading (line spacing) was not a luxury — it was the standard. Legal briefs used 2pt leading or more above the font size (the Supreme Court rules specify "12-point type with 2-point or more leading"). Annual reports from the era used proportionally generous leading, often 125–140% of the point size.

**The contemporary error:** Digital word processing defaults to single-spacing (100% leading), which compresses text into a dense field that communicates volume over quality. The prestige aesthetic set text at 120–140% leading, which gave individual lines room to exist independently before the eye moved to the next.

### Tracking — Optical, Not Mathematical

The prestige legal aesthetic did not track type aggressively. Text was not letterspaced widely (fashion) or compressed narrowly (text-dense corporate). The tracking was optical — adjusted visually to look correctly proportioned, which means slightly more open in display applications and standard in text applications.

Critically: **headlines and display text should not be tracked tightly.** Tight tracking reads as contemporary editorial design. The prestige legal aesthetic tracked display text loosely — the letters breathed. Small caps in headers were often tracked slightly more openly to compensate for their reduced size.

### Hierarchy Through Scale, Not Color

The prestige legal typographic hierarchy used size differentials rather than color changes to establish hierarchy. Body text at 12pt; subheadings at 14pt; section titles at 18pt. The same typeface, the same color, different sizes.

This produces a page that communicates **authority through control** rather than communication through decoration. The reader is guided by subtle scale differences, not pointed at by color or weight. This is exactly the visual equivalent of speaking quietly — it commands more attention, not less.

### Running Heads and Folios at 8pt in Small Caps

The small print — the pagination, the document title running at the top or bottom of each page — appeared in small caps at 8pt. This is a detail almost no one consciously notices, but it is immediately legible to trained eyes as a marker of professional typesetting. It communicates: this document was designed.

## TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SECOND CHAIR

*Based on the research above — proposed for evaluation as Track 2 distinctive asset candidates*

**Primary Text Face:** Adobe Caslon Pro (Carol Twombly, 1990)
- Body text: Caslon Pro Regular, 12pt, 16pt leading (133%), on cream stock
- Old-style figures throughout — never lining figures in body text
- True small caps for firm name, section headers, running heads
- Italic for emphasis, case citations, titles — not bold

**Display/Headline Face:** Big Caslon (Matthew Carter, 1994)
- Headlines and display applications: 24pt and above
- More dramatic stroke contrast than Caslon Pro at text sizes
- Appropriate for homepage headings, document title pages, pitch deck headers
- Available on macOS; also through Font Bureau

**Data Exhibits:** Century Schoolbook (Monotype)
- All numerical presentations, tables, data exhibits: Century Schoolbook
- The legal connotation of Century becomes an implicit certification of the data
- Figures in Century read as if submitted to court — which is the correct implication
- Applied consistently to all ROI, case data, and territory metrics

**The typographic distinctive asset candidate:** The specific pairing of Adobe Caslon Pro at text size with Century Schoolbook for data exhibits — an unusual combination that has internal logic (book typography meeting legal document typography) and is currently used by no competitor in the legal lead gen category. This combination requires typographic knowledge to execute correctly, which itself communicates competence.

---

## WHAT THIS RESEARCH CONFIRMS ABOUT THE BRIEF

1. **Century Schoolbook is the strongest Track 2 candidate** — it has the most specific institutional coding (SCOTUS mandate), the most distinctive visual character (ball terminals, broad proportions, generous x-height), and is currently used by no competitor in the PI lead gen category. At display sizes, it is surprising and authoritative in equal measure.

2. **The correct Garamond is Adobe Garamond, not ITC Garamond** — For a brand seeking to signal deep typographic knowledge, the choice between these two is legible to the target audience. ITC Garamond is authentic to the period but widely recognized by designers as a dilution. Adobe Garamond communicates that Second Chair did the research.

3. **Adobe Caslon Pro is the institutional body text standard** — Its connection to the founding documents, The New Yorker, and the federal court's own brief recommendations makes it the most defensible typographic choice for a brand claiming authority in the legal space.

4. **The typographic system matters as much as the typeface** — Small caps, generous leading, old-style figures, hierarchy through scale: these are the signals that distinguish authentic legal typography from costume legal typography. The typeface alone is insufficient.

5. **Times New Roman is the absence of decision** — It should be understood as the default this aesthetic is implicitly contrasting with. Second Chair should look nothing like a court brief filed in Times New Roman, which is exactly what every competitor in the category currently looks like.

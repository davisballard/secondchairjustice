## RESEARCH DOCUMENTS — BY SECTION

### 01 — Typography
**`01_Typography/TYPOGRAPHY_SYSTEM.md`**
The complete typographic system for the 1986–1995 legal prestige aesthetic. Covers Century Schoolbook (the primary Track 2 candidate and Supreme Court brief standard), Adobe Caslon Pro (institutional body text), Adobe Garamond vs. ITC Garamond (the critical distinction), Palatino (confirmed Goldman Sachs typeface), Bodoni (display only), and Trajan (film title reference). Includes the full specification for the small caps convention — the most important typographic decision in the brand system.

**`01_Typography/TYPOGRAPHY_RESEARCH.md`**
Web-researched primary source documentation: Fonts In Use analysis, Supreme Court brief rule verification, U.S. Seventh Circuit brief guidelines (Times New Roman explicitly rejected), Harvard Law Review typeface correction (Old Style 7, not Century Schoolbook), and modern equivalents for each canonical face.

**Key correction:** Harvard Law Review uses Old Style 7 (modern proxy: Hoefler Text). Century Schoolbook is the Supreme Court standard. Both are valid references but they cite different institutional sources.

---

### 02 — Color
**`02_Color/COLOR_SYSTEM_RESEARCH.md`**
The complete color system, with each color derived from a physical object in the prestige legal world. Oxford Navy, Burgundy/Oxblood, Forest Green, Old Gold/Brass, Cream/Ivory, Warm Charcoal, Warm Grey. Includes Track 2 assessment for each color, specific hex values, Pantone starting points, paper stock recommendations, and digital application notes.

**Key finding:** The specific cream (`#F5F0E8`) is the highest-priority Track 2 candidate in the color system. It is completely unclaimed by competitors and creates an immediate categorical distinction.

**Key correction incorporated:** The Economist's off-white is `#F5F4F0` (slightly cooler than Second Chair's proposed cream). Both are valid — the warmer version reads as cotton-rag stationery (Second Chair's target), the cooler as newsprint stock (the Economist's target).

---

### 03 — Data Visualization
**`03_Data_Visualization/DATA_VIZ_RESEARCH.md`**
The complete data visualization standard for Second Chair, derived from: Edward Tufte's VDQI (1983) and Envisioning Information (1990), the Wall Street Journal chart style (1986–1994), The Economist's chart system (confirmed: Economist Red `#E3120B`, chart conventions, single-accent-color rule), McKinsey's exhibit convention, IBM's annual report table design, and Fortune 500's ranking table design.

**The "Exhibit" naming convention is the highest-priority Track 2 candidate in data visualization.** Zero competitors in PI lead gen use it. It signals analytical rigor immediately recognizable to the target audience.

---

### 04 — Law Publications
**`04_Law_Publications/LAW_PUBLICATIONS_AND_ADJACENT_BRANDS.md`**
Primary source visual research from web fetching: The American Lawyer (current vs. historical), Harvard Law Review (confirmed: Old Style 7 typeface; maroon buckram binding; gilt-stamped spines; no photographs in 127+ years; small caps for all section headers), West Publishing color system (confirmed: Burgundy + gold for Federal series; Forest Green + gold for state series; Century as "official font of the U.S. Court System"), Goldman Sachs annual report design (confirmed: Arnold Saks Associates; Palatino typeface; Burt Glinn photography), The Economist (exact hex values confirmed), Merrill Lynch (campaign and visual language documented), Edward Tufte (design principles and physical book design documented).

---

### 05 — Adjacent Brands
**`05_Adjacent_Brands/ADJACENT_BRANDS_RESEARCH.md`**
Detailed visual analysis of: Goldman Sachs annual reports (the primary reference), American Express, Merrill Lynch "A Breed Apart" campaign, Wall Street Journal, Fortune Magazine, McKinsey Quarterly, Harvard Business Review, Time Magazine, and IBM corporate materials under Paul Rand. Includes a physical object reference guide (the Partner's business card, the West Reporter volume), a reference acquisition list (what to buy and where), and digital archive access points.

---

### 06 — Film & Television Production Design
**`06_Film_TV_Production_Design/PRODUCTION_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md`**
Production design documentation for five primary film/TV references: L.A. Law (1986–1994) as the primary reference; The Firm (1993); Presumed Innocent (1990); A Few Good Men (1992); Wall Street (1987); The Paper Chase (1973/1983); Philadelphia (1993). Each entry documents the specific colors, materials, proportions, and lighting quality of the prestige legal environment. Includes a consolidated palette table with hex approximations derived from on-screen analysis.

**The wall temperature finding:** The consistent warm amber (2700K incandescent) color temperature across all prestige legal environments is a design system principle — Second Chair's palette should always tend warm.

---

### 07 — Psychographic Research
**`07_Psychographic_Research/ATTORNEY_PSYCHOGRAPHIC_RESEARCH.md`**
Primary source web research into PI attorney attitudes toward their professional identity, the prestige legal aesthetic, and what has been lost. Documents: the origin of the ambulance chaser stigma (structurally embedded since Bates v. State Bar, 1977), primary source quotes from attorneys in their own words, the BigLaw prestige aesthetic as an object of longing rather than resentment, the visual clichés (gavel, scales) as performed prestige, the TSR Injury Law renovation case study ("he doesn't want less gravity — he wants gravity without intimidation"), and implications for Second Chair's creative direction.

**The headline finding:** "The prestige aesthetic was a reputation system, not decoration." PI attorneys mourn what the look *meant* — not the look itself.

---

### 08 — Competitive Visual Audit
**`08_Competitive_Visual_Audit/COMPETITIVE_AUDIT.md`**
Live website audit of 7 competitors in the PI lead gen category, conducted from actual site visits: smith.ai (the category design standout — SaaS palette, tech positioning), settlement allies (premium positioning, non-premium execution), growth.legal (anti-promise challenger brand — the most interesting zag in the category), brokercalls.com (category floor), injuryleadshub.com (template site), upperhandinjury.com (B2C lead funnel), quintessaint.ai (mva product) (aspirational benchmark — scarcity-framed, no pricing, no urgency).

**The headline finding:** The prestige legal aesthetic is completely unclaimed in the competitive landscape. Not one vendor is moving toward it.

---

### 09 — Distinctive Asset Candidates
**`09_Distinctive_Asset_Candidates/DISTINCTIVE_ASSET_CANDIDATES.md`**
Byron Sharp's framework applied to Second Chair's aesthetic choices. Six ranked candidate assets: Century Schoolbook small caps wordmark (highest priority), the cream background as brand field (highest priority), the burgundy application convention (high priority), the Exhibit naming convention for data (high priority), the legal pad format for documents (medium priority), and the warm amber photography standard (medium priority). Includes the consistency directive: once chosen, these assets do not change.

## THE THREE IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

**Before any moodboard is assembled, these three actions will accelerate the entire creative process:**

**1. The wordmark test (do this first):**
Download Century Schoolbook Pro (Adobe Fonts). Set "SECOND CHAIR" in small caps at 48pt in warm charcoal on cream background. Compare this to the current Second Chair wordmark. This single test answers 60% of the typographic questions.

**2. The physical reference acquisition (this week):**
Order from a used law book dealer: 3 volumes of the Federal Reporter (burgundy spine) and 1 volume of a state reporter (forest green spine). These are the single most important physical references in the entire research library. They will calibrate the burgundy and forest green color values with precision that no digital reference can match. Cost: approximately $20–45.

**3. The exhibit materials test (this week):**
Take any existing Second Chair presentation or pitch deck. Rebuild one slide using: cream background, Century Schoolbook headers in small caps, "Exhibit 1:" label, burgundy section divider, Caslon Pro body text. Show this to a PI attorney who has seen Second Chair materials before. Their response is the most direct available test of the aesthetic direction.

## THE DECISION FILTER (Hegarty Quality Gate)

Before any reference is included in the official Second Chair moodboard, it must pass all five tests:

1. **The Office Test (Hegarty):** "Does this feel like something that would have hung on the wall of a Partner's office at Cravath, Swaine & Moore in 1990?" If not, it's too casual, too modern, or too generic.

2. **The ZAG Test (Hegarty):** "Is this the opposite of what a PI lead gen vendor would show?" If it's consistent with what competitors show, it's not distinctive enough.

3. **The Deep Trope Test (Graham):** "Is this the deep version of this aesthetic, or is it the costume version?" Costume versions are recognizable from the surface. Deep versions are recognizable from the interior.

4. **The Distinctiveness Test (Sharp):** "Is this element exclusively or primarily associated with Second Chair in the PI lead gen space?" If competitors use it freely, it cannot be a primary asset.

5. **The Restraint Test (Massimo):** "Does this need to be here? What does it add that silence would not?" If the answer is uncertain, remove it.

## WHAT'S STILL OUTSTANDING

**Physical research that requires human action:**
- Acquire physical West Reporter volumes and calibrate color values
- Acquire a physical Harvard Law Review issue for typographic study
- Acquire a physical Goldman Sachs annual report from the 1980s
- Visit ProQuest Historical Newspapers at a library: pull WSJ and Fortune pages from 1987–1993 for the chart and layout references
- Obtain Crane Lettra paper samples for cream value calibration

**Research that requires premium archive access:**
- Duke University Ad Access for Merrill Lynch 1980s print advertising
- Library digital databases (JSTOR, ProQuest) for HLR digital archives
- IBM Corporate Archives for 1986–1994 annual reports

**Creative decisions requiring Davis:**
- Which typographic system option (Supreme Court / Goldman Sachs / Law Review)
- Whether to nominate the wordmark as Candidate 1 or wait for wordmark development phase
- Whether to include green as a secondary palette element or commit to burgundy as sole accent

# Section 1: INTRODUCTORY TEXT (Insight Hub)

The introductory text is the primary copy field for LinkedIn Sponsored Content ads.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Character limit** | 600 characters | Full text allowed |
| **Visible before truncation** | ~150 characters | Critical real estate |
| **Placement** | Above the creative | First thing users see |

---

## The 150-Character Challenge

While LinkedIn allows 600 characters, only ~150 show before "see more" truncation. This is your hook space.

### First 150 Characters Must Include

1. **Hook/Attention grabber** — Why should a professional care?
2. **Value proposition** — What's in it for them?
3. **Relevance signal** — Why this matters to their professional life

---

## Professional Tone Requirements

> **Key Insight:** LinkedIn users expect professional, informative content. Sales-heavy or emotional manipulation fails here.

### Tone Spectrum for Second Chair

| ❌ Avoid (Too Casual/Aggressive) | ✅ Use (Professional/Informative) |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| "Stop! Don't sign that check!" | "Understanding your rights after a workplace incident" |
| "Insurance companies are stealing from you" | "Insurance settlements often undervalue claims" |
| "You deserve compensation!" | "Compensation may be available for qualifying cases" |
| "We FIGHT for you!" | "Experienced advocates handling injury cases" |

---

## Structure for LinkedIn Introductory Text

### The Professional Formula

```
Hook (first 150 chars): [Problem/Statistic/Question relevant to professionals]

Body: [Education about the issue]

Value Proposition: [What you offer]

CTA: [Clear next step]
```

### Second Chair Examples

**Example 1: Workplace-Adjacent Angle**

> "Commuting accidents affect thousands of professionals each year, often resulting in lost productivity and medical expenses. Understanding your legal options can make a significant difference in recovery. Learn more about cases being accepted in your area."

**Example 2: Financial Impact Angle**

> "The average car accident costs victims $X in lost wages and medical bills—a significant impact on career and finances. Compensation may be available for qualifying cases. Free case evaluations available."

**Example 3: Educational Angle**

> "Most accident victims don't realize their initial settlement offer is negotiable. Insurance companies routinely offer less than cases are worth. Find out what your case may qualify for—no obligation consultation."

### Message Ad Example

```
Hi [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some 
information that may be valuable if you or someone you know 
has been in a car accident recently.

Many accident victims don't realize that initial insurance 
settlement offers are often significantly lower than what 
cases are actually worth. Understanding your legal options 
can make a meaningful difference in the recovery process.

Our team has helped thousands of clients navigate the claims 
process. We offer free, no-obligation case evaluations to 
help you understand what your situation may qualify for.

If you'd like to learn more, I'd be happy to connect you 
with one of our experienced attorneys for a confidential 
conversation.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
[Name]
Second Chair
```

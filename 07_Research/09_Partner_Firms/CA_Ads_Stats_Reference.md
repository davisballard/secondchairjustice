# California Ads & Landing Page Stats Reference

> **Brand:** Claim Justice Now (Second Chair White Label)
> **Attorney Partner:** Larry H. Parker
> **Market:** California
> **Last Updated:** January 30, 2026

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: FIRM NAME USAGE RULES

**The partner firm name (Larry H. Parker) can ONLY appear in these 3 places:**

| Location | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **1. Form fine print / disclosure** | "Claim Justice Now is a marketing partner of Larry H. Parker..." |
| **2. Consent checkbox** | "I consent to receive calls/texts from Larry H. Parker" |
| **3. Thank You page header** | "Larry H. Parker will review your case" |

**EVERYWHERE ELSE — use stats WITHOUT the firm name:**
- ✅ Ads: "$2.2 Billion Recovered for CA Accident Victims"
- ✅ Landing page hero: "We've Recovered Over $2.2 Billion"
- ✅ Trust badges: "$2.2B+ Recovered • 95% Success Rate • 45+ Years"
- ✅ Testimonials: Use quote + first name only (no firm mention in ad)
- ❌ Ads: "Larry H. Parker has recovered $2.2 Billion" — NOT in ads

**Why:** The consumer-facing brand is "Claim Justice Now" — the attorney name only appears at consent/disclosure points for compliance.

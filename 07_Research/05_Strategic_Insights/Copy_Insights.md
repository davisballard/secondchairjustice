## Behavioral Science Copy Framework

### The 6 Psychological Triggers (Ranked by PI Effectiveness)

| Rank | Trigger | Copy Approach | Example |
|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | **Loss Aversion** | Frame as losing rights/money vs. gaining | "Don't lose your right to..." > "Get compensation" |
| 2 | **Regret Aversion** | Invoke future self looking back | "5 years from now, will you wish..." |
| 3 | **Authority Contrast** | David vs. Goliath framing | "They have teams of lawyers. You have us." |
| 4 | **Information Asymmetry** | Insider knowledge positioning | "What adjusters are trained not to tell you..." |
| 5 | **Temporal Scarcity** | Deadline urgency (real, not fake) | "Evidence disappears faster than you think..." |
| 6 | **Moral Outrage** | Fairness violation framing | "They profit when you accept less." |

### Word Substitution Matrix

Replace weak benefit language with stronger loss/protection language:

| ❌ Weak (Benefit Frame) | ✅ Strong (Loss Frame) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| "Get compensation" | "Don't lose your right to compensation" |
| "We fight for you" | "They're fighting against you. We level the field." |
| "Free consultation" | "Find out what you might be missing" |
| "Maximize your settlement" | "Don't leave money on the table" |
| "We can help" | "Don't handle this alone against their team" |

### The "Asymmetric Information" Formula

**Structure:** [What they know] + [What you don't know] + [Revelation]

> "Insurance adjusters are trained to seem helpful. But their job is to pay you less. Here's what they won't tell you..."

This formula activates:
- Threat detection (they're working against you)
- Curiosity gap (what don't I know?)
- Authority positioning (lawyer as insider)

## The Victim Psychology Journey

> **Source:** Patrick Slaughter — Understanding where the victim IS mentally determines what message will land.

When someone is injured, they move through predictable emotional stages. Your copy must meet them where they are.

### Stage 1: Shock & Confusion (0-48 hours)
- **They're thinking:** "What just happened? What do I do now?"
- **They're NOT ready to hire.** They're trying to process.
- **Copy approach:** Educational. "What to do after an accident" guides.
- **Headline style:** Informational, not sales-focused.

### Stage 2: Pain & Anger (Days 2-14)
- **They're thinking:** "This shouldn't have happened. Someone is responsible."
- Physical pain is peaking. Anger at the person who caused it.
- **Copy approach:** Validation. "You deserve justice." "It wasn't your fault."
- **Headline style:** Accountability-focused.

### Stage 3: Overwhelm & Fear (Weeks 2-8)
- **They're thinking:** "Medical bills are piling up. I can't work. The insurance company keeps calling."
- **Copy approach:** Trust and reassurance. "We handle everything." "No fee unless we win."
- **Headline style:** Risk-reversal, burden-lifting.

### Stage 4: Decision & Action (Weeks 4-12)
- **They're thinking:** "I need to hire an attorney. Who can I trust?"
- Comparing options. Looking for proof.
- **Copy approach:** Social proof, case results, reviews.
- **Headline style:** Results-focused, credibility.

### The 5 Emotional States to Address

Every piece of copy should acknowledge at least one:

| State | What They Feel | What They Need to Hear (Current) |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Fear** | "Will I be okay? Will I recover?" | "You're not alone in this situation." |
| **Anger** | "This shouldn't have happened to me." | "The person who hurt you should be held accountable." |
| **Confusion** | "I don't know how any of this works." | "Here's exactly what happens next." |
| **Distrust** | "Lawyers are all the same / just want money." | "We only get paid if you win." |
| **Helplessness** | "I can't handle this on my own." | "We handle everything. You focus on healing." |

> **Future Enhancement (P3):** When creator partnerships are active, add real client reviews and testimonials to address Fear and Distrust more powerfully.

## The First 3 Seconds

**For short-form video (TikTok, Reels, Shorts), the first 3 seconds are the only metric that matters.**

If the hook fails, the remaining 57 seconds are irrelevant.

---

## High-Performing Hook Archetypes

### 1. The "Stop" Hook
**Pattern:** Command + Loss aversion

> "Stop! If you were in a wreck in [City], do NOT sign the first check."

**Why it works:** Triggers loss aversion. User fears they might lose something.

---

### 2. The "Insider" Hook
**Pattern:** Authority via negation

> "I'm a lawyer and here are 3 things I would NEVER do after a crash."

**Why it works:** "NEVER" implies insider knowledge. Establishes authority through what NOT to do.

---

### 3. The "Incredulous" Hook
**Pattern:** Curiosity through disbelief

> "I literally cannot believe insurance adjusters get away with this..."

**Why it works:** Triggers curiosity. User needs to know what "this" is.

---

### 4. The "Visual" Hook
**Pattern:** Pattern interrupt

> Start video with weird visual: upside down camera, extreme close-up of an airbag, Green Screen over news clip.

**Why it works:** Breaks the scroll trance through visual novelty.

---

### 5. The "Myth Buster" Hook
**Pattern:** Common belief + contradiction

> "Everyone thinks if you rear-end someone, it's automatically your fault. Wrong."

**Why it works:** Challenges assumed knowledge. User wants to know the truth.

---

## The "Dual Creator" Format

Split-screen or cut-sequence with two roles:

**Victim (Naive Question):**
> "My boss said I can't get workers' comp because I didn't report it immediately."

**Lawyer (Correction):**
> "False. In [State], you have 30 days. Here's what you need to do..."

**Why it works:** Mimics conversation. Feels like eavesdropping on a helpful tip rather than receiving a lecture.

---

## Video Script Template: The "Viral Stitch"

**Concept:** Reacting to viral dashcam video or news clip

```
0:00-0:03 (HOOK): 
"I can't believe the insurance adjuster told them this." 
[Points to text overlay]

0:03-0:15 (EDUCATION): 
"Most people think if you rear-end someone, it's automatically your fault. 
But in [State], if the front driver brake-checked you..."

0:15-0:25 (AUTHORITY): 
"In cases like this, the black box data often proves 
the front driver was negligent. Here's how it works..."

0:25-0:30 (CTA): 
"Don't admit fault at the scene. Call us first. Link in bio."
```

## Headline Formulas

### For Ads
| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| [Number] things [Authority] would never do | "3 things a lawyer would never do after a crash" |
| Don't [Action] until you [Action] | "Don't sign anything until you read this" |
| [City/State] [Case Type]: What [Group] needs to know | "Texas car accidents: What victims need to know" |
| Warning: [Product/Situation] linked to [Outcome] | "Warning: Hair relaxers linked to cancer risk" |

### For Landing Pages
| Formula | Example | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Get [Benefit] - Not [Feature] | "Get Compensated" not "We Are Lawyers" | ✅ Active |
| [Question] + [Answer teaser] | "Injured at work? You may have more options than you think." | ✅ Active |
| [Number] recovered for [Case Type] victims | "$50M+ recovered for accident victims" | ⏸️ P3 — Requires real case data |

> **Note:** Recovery amount headlines are powerful but require verifiable case results. Use benefit-driven or question-based headlines until partner firm data is available.

## CTA Insights

### What Works
| CTA | Context | Why |
|-----|---------|-----|
| "See If You Qualify" | Quiz funnels | Low commitment, curiosity |
| "Get Your Free Case Review" | Landing pages | Value exchange clear |
| "Find Out What You're Owed" | Retargeting | Implies money waiting |
| "Link in bio" | TikTok/Reels | Platform native |

### CTA Placement
- **Landing pages:** Sticky button at bottom of mobile screen (always visible)
- **Video:** Verbal + text overlay in final 5 seconds
- **Quiz funnels:** After "analyzing eligibility" loading screen (anticipation builds)

---

## Emotional Triggers That Convert

### Loss Aversion (Primary)
> "Don't lose your right to compensation"
> "Time limits may affect your options"

**Outperforms:** Benefit statements ("Get money")

### Injustice/Accountability
> "Insurance companies have teams of lawyers. Shouldn't you?"
> "They're not on your side. We are."

### Protection/Safety
> "Protect your rights"
> "Make sure you're covered"

### Empowerment
> "Take control of your situation"
> "Know your options"

---

## Quiz Funnel Copy

### The Micro-Commitment Sequence

**Q1 (Easy Entry):**
> "Were you injured in an accident in the last 2 years?"

**Q2 (Qualifier):**
> "Was the accident your fault?"

**Q3 (Value Signal):**
> "Did you require medical attention?"

**Q4 (Viability Check):**
> "Do you currently have an attorney?"

**Loading Screen:**
> "Analyzing your eligibility..." [Progress bar]

**Lead Capture:**
> "Great news — you may qualify for significant compensation. Where should we send your free case evaluation?"

**Why it works:** Sunk cost fallacy + consistency principle. After answering 4 questions, user is psychologically committed to completing the process.

**Performance:** 15-25% conversion on cold traffic (vs 2-5% for static forms)

---

## Intake Script Copy

### Empathy First

❌ **Don't start with:**
> "What is your insurance policy number?"

✅ **Start with:**
> "I'm so sorry to hear about what happened. First, are you safe and receiving the medical care you need?"

### The "Double Tap" SMS

When call isn't answered, immediate text:
> "Hi [Name], this is [Firm Name]. I just received your inquiry about the accident. I'm reviewing it now — are you free for a quick 2-minute call to confirm details?"

---

## Brand Voice Direction

### Old Paradigm: "Aggressive Dog"
- "We FIGHT for you"
- "Bulldog attorneys"
- Aggressive, combative

### New Paradigm: "Protector/Guide"
- "We're here to help you through this"
- "Let us handle the insurance companies"
- Empathetic, authoritative

**For @Senior_Copywriter:**
Move from attack language to protection language. The client is vulnerable — they want a guide, not a gladiator.

---

## What Doesn't Work

### Generic Phrases (Banner Blindness)
- "We Fight For You"
- "No Win, No Fee" (overused)
- "Free Consultation" (expected, not differentiating)

### Second Person + Injury (Compliance + Performance)
- "Were you hurt?" (banned + feels invasive)
- "Are you injured?" (banned + triggers defenses)

### Guarantees (Compliance Risk)
- "We'll get you $100,000"
- "Guaranteed settlement"
- "Maximum compensation"

---

## Power Words (Compliant)

| Word | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| "Entitled" | "You may be entitled to compensation" |
| "Qualify" | "See if you qualify" |
| "Options" | "Know your legal options" |
| "Rights" | "Protect your rights" |
| "Review" | "Free case review" |
| "Evaluation" | "Free evaluation" |

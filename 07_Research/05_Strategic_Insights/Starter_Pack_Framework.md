## The Core Insight

**What you're building:** "Reddit Starter Pack" style imagery—hyper-specific visual clichés of target demographics in target locations.

**Why it works:** When someone sees their regional/lifestyle archetype perfectly depicted, their identity gets activated. Once identity is active, they process everything through that lens—and they can't scroll past.

---

## Behavioral Science Validation

Your approach is backed by 15+ studies in the Behavioral Library:

### Identity Salience Effect
*Forehand, Deshpandé & Reed, 2002*
> "Making an identity salient increases message effectiveness. Identity-relevant messages boost engagement."

**Application:** The "Bend Oregon guy" triggers identity recognition before the brain can filter it as "just an ad."

---

### Cialdini's Localized Norms
*Hotel Towel Experiment, 2008*
> "Localized norms ('people in this room') outperformed generic. Hyper-relevant social proof wins."

**Application:** "People in Bend who drive on Highway 97" > "People in Oregon" > "People who drive"

The more hyper-local, the more stopping power.

---

### Self-Verification Theory
*Swann, 1983-1996*
> "People seek to confirm existing self-views. Messages consistent with identity are more persuasive."

**Application:** When people see themselves accurately depicted—including the clichés—they lean in. It's recognition, not mockery.

---

### Frijda's Law of Apparent Reality
*1988*
> "The intensity of emotion depends on how real or likely an event seems. Use concrete imagery and relatable scenarios."

**Application:** 
- Generic "car accident victim" = abstract
- **45-year-old Bend local in a North Face vest who just hit black ice on Galveston Avenue** = viscerally real

---

### Von Restorff Effect (Distinctiveness)
*Capaldi & Neath, 2000*
> "Distinctive items are remembered better than uniform ones. Contrast in context boosts memory."

**Application:** A generic "person on phone" = invisible. A **very specific person who looks like they shop at REI, drives a Tacoma, and has never missed a Sunday farmers market** = distinctive, memorable.

---

## Why "Love or Hate" Works

From **White & Argo's Identity Threat Study**:
> "Threats to identity increase preference for affirming products."

When people see a hyper-specific cliché of "their type":
- **They love it** → Identity is validated → Scroll stops → Engagement
- **They "hate" it (but recognize it)** → Defensive curiosity → Scroll stops → Engagement

Either way: **scroll stopped**.

## The Starter Pack Person Checklist

For each geo/demo target, build a **composite character** with these elements:

| Element | What to Define | Why It Works |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Age** | Specific decade (35-45, 55-65) | Identity schemas are age-specific |
| **Clothing** | Regional/cultural uniform | Instant "that's me" recognition |
| **Accessories** | What's in their hands/on them | Lifestyle signaling |
| **Vehicle** | What they drive | Strong identity marker |
| **Environment** | Where they ARE | Context-dependent memory |
| **Expression** | Face/body language | Emotional priming |
| **Props** | Background objects | Semantic priming |

---

## Regional Starter Pack Database Template

For each target geo, document:

| Category | Define This |
|----------|-------------|
| **Uniform** | What does "this person" wear? Brand-level specific. |
| **Vehicle** | What do they drive? Make/model specific. |
| **Drink** | What are they holding? Coffee brand, beer type, etc. |
| **Activity** | What do they do on weekends? |
| **Store** | Where do they shop? What stores define them? |
| **Dog** | What breed? (People ALWAYS have dogs) |
| **Expression** | What's the vibe? "Outdoorsy zen," "Wellness optimized," etc. |
| **Local landmarks** | What background screams THIS PLACE? |
| **Local roads** | What highway/intersection does everyone know? |

## Scroll-Stopping Power: How to "Ramp It Up"

### The Compliant Ways to Maximize Impact

#### 1. FACE + DIRECT EYE CONTACT
From approved imagery: *"Face with emotion—humans are wired to look at faces"*

**The Ramp-Up:** Instead of looking away, have them **look directly at camera with a knowing expression**. Not distress—**recognition**.

---

#### 2. HYPER-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT CUES
From Cognitive Ease research: *"Contextual cues improve recall"*

**The Ramp-Up:** 
- ❌ Generic "mountain background"
- ✅ **That specific intersection everyone knows**
- ✅ **The exact parking lot at the local landmark**
- ✅ **Standing in front of the local brewery/coffee shop**

---

#### 3. THE "PATTERN INTERRUPT" COMPOSITION
From Approved_Imagery.md: *"Unusual composition creates pattern interrupt"*

**Options:**
- Extreme close-up on face (unusual for legal ads)
- Dutch angle (tilted frame)
- Person walking toward camera
- Unexpected crop (cut off top of head)
- "Caught mid-action" not posed

---

#### 4. TEXT OVERLAY WITH IDENTITY CALL-OUT
From Cognitive Ease: *"Text overlay creates curiosity gap"*

**Templates:**
- "Every [City] driver has been here..."
- "If you know, you know..."
- "POV: You drive [Local Road] every weekend"
- "[City] [archetype]: This is for you..."

---

#### 5. HIGH CONTRAST COLOR POPS
From Color Weapons: *"Contrast matters more than the specific color"*

**The Ramp-Up:**
- One **bright element** (orange vest, red jacket, yellow hat) against neutral background
- That element draws the eye FIRST
- Use `#FF4500` or `#E63946` for text overlays

---

## AI Prompt Template (Master)

### Ramp-Up Modifiers (Add ONE)

| Modifier | What It Does |

| "walking toward camera with purpose" | Movement energy |
| "caught mid-laugh in candid moment" | Authenticity signal |
| "single [bright color] element against neutral background" | Color pop |
| "morning golden hour light casting long shadows" | Cinematic quality |

## Compliance Framework (Traffic Light System)

### 🟢 GREEN - Safe + Effective

| Element | Compliant Version |
|---------|------------------|
| **Person** | Healthy, neutral expression, NOT in distress |
| **Setting** | Public space, recognizable location |
| **Clothing** | Lifestyle markers (outdoor gear, work clothes, regional uniform) |
| **Expression** | Knowing, confident, or "caught in moment" |
| **Text** | Third-person language, no "you" + condition |
| **Props** | Non-medical (coffee, phone, dog, car keys) |

---

### 🟡 YELLOW - Proceed with Caution

| Element | Risk | Mitigation |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Crutches/cast** | Can work if POSITIVE context | Show cast with signatures, person smiling |
| **Car visible** | Fine unless damaged | No damage visible, normal car |
| **Emergency lights** | Can trigger sensational | Use as distant blur, not focus |
| **"After the accident" implication** | Risky if person looks distressed | Focus on RECOVERY chapter, not trauma |

---

### 🔴 RED - Do Not Use

| Element | Why Banned |
|---------|-----------|
| Blood/visible injury | Meta Chapter 13, instant rejection |
| Distress/crying | Personal attributes + exploitation |
| Accident scene with victim | Sensational content |
| Wheelchair with distress | Disability = personal attribute |
| "YOU" + condition | Personal attributes ban |

## Saul's Compliance Review

> **Saul:** "Alright, let me weigh in here. I like where your head's at. The 'starter pack' approach is smart—hyper-specific without getting personal.
>
> 🟢 **What's working:**
> - You're NOT saying 'you were injured' — you're saying 'if you drive here, you know'
> - Identity activation without personal attribute violations
> - Third-person framing is intact
>
> 🟡 **Watch for this:**
> - Don't make the person LOOK like they just got out of an accident
> - No crutches, casts, or medical equipment in these identity shots
> - The 'knowing expression' can't be 'distressed expression'
>
> 🔴 **Hard stops:**
> - If you show their car, it can't be damaged
> - If you show them, they can't be in pain
> - 'POV: You just got hurt' = banned. 'POV: You drive this road' = fine.
>
> Bottom line: You're telling the story from the BEFORE chapter or the AFTER chapter. Never the DURING chapter. 'This is who you are and where you live' — not 'this is you bleeding on the pavement.'
>
> Risk Score: 2 out of 5. Safe territory with scroll-stopping power. Run it."

## For Agency Workers

### @Graham_Fink
Use this framework to build region-specific starter pack databases. Each geo campaign should have its own archetype sheet before production begins.

### @Senior_Copywriter
Use the text overlay templates in conjunction with `Hooks_And_Angles.md`. Pair identity-charged visuals with identity-charged copy.

### @Head_of_Performance
Test different archetypes within the same geo. "Austin Tech Mom" vs "Austin Construction Foreman" — let data decide which converts.

### @Saul
Review new regional archetypes before production. Flag any that lean into medical/distress territory.

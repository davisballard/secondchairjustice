# Session 04: Company Deep Dive
## Second Chair — Internal Analysis

**Quadrant:** Company (4th C of Julian Cole's 4Cs Framework)
**Status:** Planned — Not yet started
**Program Lead:** Julian Cole, Head of Strategy

---

## Purpose

The Company Deep Dive examines Second Chair from the inside. Where the Consumer, Category, and Culture sessions look outward (at audiences, competitors, and the world), the Company session turns the lens inward — to understand what Second Chair actually is, what makes it genuinely different, and what it can credibly claim.

---

## Research Agenda (Planned)

### Core Questions to Answer

1. **What does Second Chair actually do differently?** — Product truth vs. category claims
2. **What is the origin story?** — The founding insight, the "why now," the problem the founder saw
3. **What does the team believe?** — Internal values that inform the external brand
4. **What do current clients say?** — Unfiltered testimonials, NPS reality, churn reasons
5. **What does Second Chair's data show?** — Performance benchmarks, quality proof, conversion vs. industry
6. **Where is Second Chair genuinely better?** — Areas of demonstrable superiority vs. competitors
7. **What are the honest limitations?** — Things Second Chair doesn't do, markets not yet served

## Cross-Reference: What Previous Sessions Tell Us About the Company

The first three sessions surface clues about what Second Chair would need to be true to own its positioning:

- **Session 01 (Consumer):** Attorneys need certainty + honest advertising. If Second Chair runs honest B2C ads, this is a *product feature*, not just a brand claim.
- **Session 02 (Category):** No competitor has claimed quality + honesty. The white space exists. Does Second Chair's product back it up?
- **Session 03 (Culture):** The cultural purpose is "honest advertising as reform." Second Chair's business model (CPSC not CPL) is the structural reason it can keep this promise. This must be verified and documented.

*This session should be initiated once the brand strategy brief is drafted from Sessions 01–03 synthesis. The Company Deep Dive grounds the strategy in verifiable truth.*

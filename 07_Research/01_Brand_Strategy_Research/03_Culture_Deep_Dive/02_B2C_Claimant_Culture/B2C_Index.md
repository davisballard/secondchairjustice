## Purpose

This research supports Second Chair's brand strategy by deepening understanding of the **claimant** — the accident victim who becomes a lead. While the B2B research focuses on the PI attorney buyer, this Culture Deep Dive maps the cultural, economic, and psychological territory of the person on the other end of the funnel.

## Why Insurance Distrust Is Brand-Adjacent for Second Chair

Second Chair's B2C advertising doesn't explicitly position against insurance companies. But the cultural landscape it advertises into is defined by insurance distrust — accident victims are already in an adversarial posture toward the companies that will be handling their claims. Understanding that distrust, its historical roots, its specific triggers, and its manifestation in different communities is essential for advertising that speaks to the real emotional state of the person seeing it.

The goal of this document is not to tell Second Chair to "be anti-insurance." It's to map the cultural territory so that Second Chair's advertising lands in the right emotional register — acknowledging the reality that potential claimants are living without exploiting it.

## 1. "Delay, Deny, Defend" — The Phrase That Named an Industry Practice

### The Origin

**Jay M. Feinman**, Professor of Law at Rutgers, published *Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It* in 2010 (Portfolio/Penguin, 256 pages). The book documented what Feinman characterized as the systematic strategy of major insurance companies to:

- **Delay:** Prolong claims processing through bureaucratic requirements, demands for additional documentation, claims of incomplete or incorrect forms — frustrating claimants into abandoning their claims or accepting inadequate settlements
- **Deny:** Reject valid claims outright or offer far below the fair value of covered losses
- **Defend:** Aggressively litigate rather than honor policy obligations

The phrase entered the cultural vocabulary in legal and consumer advocacy circles. But its mainstream moment came in December 2024.

### The Brian Thompson Moment

**December 2024:** UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was murdered outside a hotel in Manhattan. The ammunition used in the killing was inscribed with the words **"deny," "defend," "depose"** — a deliberate echo of Feinman's "delay, deny, defend" phrase that reflected the killer's apparent motivation in insurance company practices.

The event renewed national attention to insurance company claim handling. UnitedHealthcare covers 49 million Americans and had come under significant criticism for high prior authorization denial rates in Medicare Advantage, denying breakthrough medications for Alzheimer's and obesity treatment, and complicating routine care authorizations.

**The cultural moment:** For weeks following the Thompson killing, insurance industry practices dominated public conversation in a way they never had before. People who had personal experiences with claim denials spoke publicly. The "delay, deny, defend" phrase — which had circulated in legal and consumer advocacy circles for 14 years — suddenly reached a general audience. The cultural distrust that had been building in online communities (Reddit, TikTok, YouTube) broke into mainstream awareness.

## 2. Documented Insurance Bad Faith — The Specific Evidence

### Allstate-McKinsey: The Blueprint for Claim Minimization

The most extensively documented case of systematic insurance company bad faith is **Allstate's engagement with McKinsey & Company** in the 1990s to redesign their claims processing system:

- McKinsey produced 12,000+ PowerPoint slides and approximately 150,000 pages of documentation
- The strategy: intentionally low offers; prolonged delays to frustrate claimants; "in good hands" treatment for quick settlers; "boxing gloves" for those who contested
- The **"alligator approach"**: prolonged waiting designed to pressure claimants into accepting inadequate compensation
- **Results:** $700 million saved; profits doubled to $4.6 billion by 2007; bodily injury payouts reduced by more than 20%; injured parties paid approximately 30% below market value for their claims
- **Colossus:** A software system deployed by Allstate that reduced PI claim values by up to 20% through formula-based evaluation that adjusters could manipulate
- **Consequences:** Allstate paid a $2.4 million fine for withholding documents related to this strategy

### State Farm: Senate Hearing 2025

State Farm's claims practices were the subject of a Senate hearing in 2025, which documented:
- Multiple adjuster reassignments designed to confuse and delay claimants
- Minimizing and excluding legitimate damages
- Pressuring claim reviewers to "down-code" injury severity
- Use of unlicensed vendors for property assessment
- Undisclosed internal reviewers providing opinions not shared with claimants
- Wind and hail claims reduced by up to 50%; documented case of $400,000 in damage resulting in a $30,000 payment offer

State Farm's history: the company pioneered claims "redesign" in 1979 with an explicit strategy to "delay, deny, and defend" — predating Feinman's book by more than three decades.

### GEICO: Bad Faith at $23 Million

A California jury found GEICO liable for bad faith, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress in 2018 — six years after a disabled Irvine man began a dispute over benefits. The jury awarded $9.9 million in general damages and $13 million in punitive damages (approximately $23 million total). GEICO had delayed benefits and ignored medical and lost wage requests for six years.

## 3. Insurance Distrust in Viral Culture: TikTok, YouTube, and Reddit

### The GEICO TikTok Ecosystem

GEICO has accumulated a specific viral reputation on TikTok for bizarre and unfair claim handling:

- **"I wasn't even in the car":** A customer documented receiving a policy revocation threat over a police report error for an accident they hadn't been involved in
- **Stolen car claim denied:** A claimant's claim denied over a Michigan form; the video received 262,000 views
- **Couple sold their SUV:** Received a claim from GEICO (not their insurer) for an accident in Jamaica, NY — a location they hadn't visited in over 20 years

These stories circulate in TikTok's algorithm because they are both outrageous and highly relatable — they confirm the cultural belief that insurance companies are adversarial actors even toward their own customers.

### Reddit: The Community of Shared Experience

Reddit communities (r/Insurance, r/legaladvice, r/Car_Insurance_Help) have become repositories of the unfiltered accident victim experience. Common themes visible across thousands of posts:

- Claim denials with explanations that don't hold up to scrutiny
- Lowball offers as the opening position — consistently below documented expenses
- Adjuster tactics: demanding more documentation, questioning liability, minimizing injury severity
- Multi-party insurance disputes (whose insurance pays what)
- The "totaled car" settlement problem: ACV (actual cash value) payments that are significantly less than what the claimant paid or would need to pay to replace the vehicle, with no compensation for taxes, title, or registration fees on a replacement

The Reddit community's default advice to anyone who posts about an insurance dispute: **get a lawyer**. This is not the result of lawyer manipulation of Reddit — it is the bottom-up conclusion of thousands of people who processed their accident claims without a lawyer and discovered too late that they should have had one.

## 4. The Cultural Language of Insurance Distrust

Based on research across Reddit, forums, and social media, the specific language accident victims use when describing their insurance experiences:

**Settlement language:**
- **"Lowball" / "lowballed"** — ubiquitous. "Insurance giving me a lowball offer for my car."
- **"They offered"** — the passive construction reflects that the insurance company is the actor; the victim is passive
- **"I'm getting screwed"** — direct and frequently used: "Someone totaled my car; I'm getting screwed by her insurance company" (Ask Metafilter)
- **"They denied"** / **"denial"** — the standard vocabulary of claim rejection
- **"They're trying to"** — insurance as adversarial agent making active efforts against the victim

**Fairness language:**
- **"Made whole"** — the moral claim: "I just want to be made whole." Not a demand for a lottery win, but for restoration to the position before the accident.
- **"Fair compensation"** — what they believe they deserve, frequently contrasted with what was offered
- **"I just want what I'm owed"** — rights framing, not greed framing

**Process language:**
- **"Adjuster runaround"** — the experience of being passed between adjusters, each requiring new documentation, as a delay tactic
- **"They claimed"** — placing blame, often in disbelief: "They claimed my mom was 'illegally parked'"

## 5. The Trust Split: Honest Admission vs. Cultural Mythology

### The "Good Neighbor" vs. Reality Gap

State Farm's "Good Neighbor" positioning is one of advertising's longest-running brand promises. The cultural reality — documented by Senate hearings, court cases, and thousands of Reddit posts — is a gap between what that promise implies and what claimants experience. The same gap exists for Allstate's "You're in Good Hands" and Progressive's "Flo" character's apparent friendliness.

The insurance industry has invested enormously in brand positioning that implies trustworthiness — and simultaneously been exposed, repeatedly and specifically, for practices that are the opposite of trustworthy. The cultural distrust that results is not ignorant cynicism. It is documented reality.

### The "Friendly Adjuster" Trap

The cultural education that the TikTok legal community has spread most effectively: **the adjuster's friendliness is a tactic, not a character trait**. Adjusters are trained to:
- Establish rapport to extract information
- Use specific phrasing to minimize claims or get the victim to admit fault
- Record statements early, before the victim has legal counsel
- Frame inadequate offers as generosity

*"Even innocent statements like 'I'm fine' can later be used as evidence."* (Legal education sources across multiple platforms)

The accident victim who has processed even minimal social media legal education knows this. The one who hasn't may not realize until it's too late.

## 6. Community-Specific Insurance Distrust

### Hispanic Communities

Insurance distrust in Hispanic communities is compounded by systemic barriers:
- Immigration status concerns: fear of deportation creating reluctance to engage any official system
- Restricted Medicaid and CHIP eligibility for non-citizens
- Jobs without employer health coverage; unaffordable private insurance
- Language barriers in navigating complex applications and insurance processes
- Limited English proficiency creating vulnerability in adjuster interactions

### Black Communities

Insurance distrust in Black communities draws on deeper wells of institutional distrust:
- Documented systematic underestimation of injury severity for Black patients by medical providers
- The Tuskegee legacy creating baseline distrust of institutions that present themselves as helpful
- **Pew Research (2024)** documents persistent Black American mistrust of U.S. healthcare system
- Actuarial tables that reduce award calculations based on race-correlated life expectancy differences
- The documented history of race-based insurance redlining

(Sources: Pew Research, BD&J, KFF, California Partnership for Access to Treatment)

### The Significance for B2C Advertising

The demographic reality of MVA claimants (61% from low-to-middle income households, disproportionately people of color) means that Second Chair's B2C advertising will primarily reach people who:

1. Face community-specific barriers to seeking legal help that go beyond general cultural stigma
2. Are at elevated risk of receiving systematically lower compensation
3. May have the most to gain from attorney representation and the least cultural permission to seek it

The advertising that reaches these communities honestly — that doesn't treat their distrust of legal and insurance institutions as a problem to be overcome, but as a reasonable response to documented institutional behavior — is the advertising that earns trust.

---

## 7. What "I Just Want to Be Made Whole" Means for Second Chair

The most important thing Second Chair's B2C advertising can do is **not add to the distrust**. The category's advertising — "2025 Compensation Program," implied government benefit programs, settlement fantasies — is distrust-generating. It promises what it can't deliver, creates expectations that attorneys spend months correcting, and reinforces the cultural sense that the legal system is just another institution trying to take advantage of vulnerable people.

Second Chair's advertising that honestly says "here's what a PI attorney can actually do for you, here's what fair means, here's what the process actually looks like" doesn't just differentiate from the category. It **restores trust in a category that has eroded it** — and does so in a way that serves the claimant, the attorney, and the relationship between them.

## FUSION LAYER — Round Table Enrichment

**Shotton — How Documented Insurance Distrust Creates Cognitive Defaults:**

High distrust of an information environment does not produce more rational evaluation. It produces more reliance on cognitive shortcuts. The accident victim who distrusts PI advertising will rely on:

1. **Authority signals** more than content: a law firm that looks credible (visual restraint, professional photography, clean typography) will receive more benefit of the doubt than one that looks like every other PI ad, regardless of the actual content of either ad
2. **Social proof from recognized sources** more than anonymous testimonials: if a named attorney (who can be Googled) is cited, distrust is partially suspended; if "J.T., Dallas" is cited, it is amplified
3. **Contrast cues**: in a high-distrust environment, advertising that doesn't do the things that activate distrust (no settlement fantasy, no "2025 Compensation Program" implication, no fabricated calculator) is trusted by default — the absence of the suspicious element is itself a trust signal

**The practical implication:** Second Chair's B2C advertising should be designed to pass the contrast test. When an accident victim sees a Second Chair ad alongside a typical PI ad, the Second Chair ad should be immediately recognizable as categorically different — not through claims of difference, but through the absence of the elements that trigger distrust.

**Ferrier — Community-Specific Ability Barriers:**

The insurance distrust map documents community-specific distrust. Ferrier's behavior change analysis maps those cultural distrust patterns onto specific ability barriers:

**Hispanic communities:** The primary ability barrier is not distrust of the legal system per se — it is fear of any interaction with official systems that could affect immigration status. The behavior change strategy: emphasize privacy, confidentiality, and that a PI consultation does not involve any official record of the claimant's status. Trusted community messengers (Spanish-language radio, community organizations) outperform mass media in this context.

**Black communities:** The primary ability barrier is institutional distrust rooted in documented historical mistreatment (Tuskegee, redlining, documented racial disparities in compensation). General assurances of trustworthiness do not penetrate this barrier. The behavior change strategy: specific documentation of outcomes for Black claimants, named Black attorney advocates, and advertising in media channels trusted by Black communities (not mass-market PI advertising which is already associated with exploitation by many Black community members).

**Fink — Visual Trust Signals in Community-Specific Contexts:**

The visual trust signals documented for the general population (restraint, named individuals, visible evidence) apply across communities but require community-specific adaptation in representation:

- **Representation in photography:** Real people who look like the community being reached. Not stock photography of generic accident scenes. Actual people from the community, photographed honestly.
- **Language:** Spanish-language advertising for Hispanic communities is not just translation — it requires cultural translation of the "know your rights" frame into the specific cultural context, with trusted community language around protection and family.
- **Absence of legal system imagery:** For communities with documented institutional distrust, imagery of courthouses, scales of justice, or police reports amplifies distrust rather than building it. The visual territory is practical and human — the kitchen table conversation, the phone call, the moment of decision — not the legal system's visual markers.

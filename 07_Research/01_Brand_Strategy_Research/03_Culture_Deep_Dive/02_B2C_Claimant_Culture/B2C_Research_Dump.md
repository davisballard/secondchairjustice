## SPECIALIST EVIDENCE (Front-Loaded)

### FOR ADAM FERRIER: Cultural Barriers to Seeking Legal Help

**Core Statistic — The "Lumping It" Problem:**
- **>90% of injury victims "lump it"** — they absorb losses without seeking compensation even when negligence is involved. Only **~4% hire lawyers**, and **2-3% actually file tort actions.**  
- Source: David M. Engel, *The Myth of the Litigious Society: Why We Don't Sue* (University of Chicago Press, 2016); Rethinking 'litigious' America, Buffalo Law School

**Why Victims Don't Sue — Three Barriers:**
1. **Physical and cognitive effects of injury:** Pain creates confusion, inhibits communication, restricts social interaction; medication clouds thinking. Victims are often unable to take action even when warranted.
2. **Self-blame and victim-blaming:** Victims widely tend to blame themselves for their injuries; others blame victims too — both inhibit claiming.
3. **Negative cultural portrayals:** Movies, TV, media spread stereotypes portraying those who sue as "reprehensible people" — discouraging victims from pursuing claims.

**Identity and Self-Perception:**
- Victims often identify as people who "don't sue." Cultural stigma discourages victims from viewing litigation as an acceptable response.
- Engel: People are culturally taught to "accept setbacks stoically and not blame someone else" rather than hold injurers accountable.
- Source: Engel (2016); Berkeley Law record; Jotwell ("ISO the Missing Plaintiff")

**The "Ambulance Chaser" Stigma:**
- The stereotype — aggressive, opportunistic, money-motivated — is deeply embedded. Hollywood (e.g., *The Rainmaker*) and media have shaped perception more than reality.
- **Consequence:** Deters people who need help from seeking it, especially those with limited resources who fear appearing litigious or vindictive. Some professionals (e.g., doctors) refuse to hire attorneys due to shame.
- Stanford Law (2022): PI attorneys consistently rank low in professional prestige; elite law schools historically ignored plaintiffs' firms.
- Source: Price Beckstrom Law, McCready Law, Stanford Law CLP/PLA Event, Skinner Firm, Patrick Daniel Law

**Religious/Cultural Attitudes Toward Litigation:**
- **1 Corinthians 6:1-8** counsels Christians not to sue other believers; avoid taking disputes "before the ungodly."
- **Matthew 18:15-18** outlines dispute resolution: direct address → mediators → church → cease.
- Motivational concerns: Christians are asked to examine whether they're motivated by vengeance vs. genuine desire to help.
- Alternative approaches: direct negotiation, Christian mediation, Christian arbitration.
- Source: Wesleyan.org, Crossway, Denison Forum, Ministry Watch

**The Minimization Instinct:**
- Collectivist cultures (e.g., Korean) emphasize not "making a big deal" of minor accidents — community harmony over individual claims.
- Psychological minimization: people use "reduction words" like "no big deal," "only a little," "just" when addressing infractions.
- In the U.S., telling doctors/insurance "I'm fine" can be used against injury claims later.
- Source: Korea Herald, Wikipedia (Minimisation psychology), Chaikin Trial Group, Atlanta Advocate

**Cultural Permission for Legal Advertising:**
- There is a significant "trust deficit" between accident victims and insurance adjusters. Friends saying "call a lawyer" reflect widespread understanding that insurers prioritize minimizing payouts.
- The "24-hour rule" has emerged: contact an attorney *before* speaking with insurance — victims are "shaken, injured, and not thinking clearly" in early hours.

### FOR LES BINET & PETER FIELD: Emotional States and Advertising Effectiveness

**Trauma and Decision-Making:**
- Heavy trauma exposure causes individuals to become more **transactional** — switch brands more, try new products, prioritize least expensive options.
- **Light trauma exposure** showed the *opposite* pattern: more receptive to advertising, willing to pay premium prices.
- Trauma shifts decision horizon; heavily traumatized individuals focus on immediate functionality and price rather than long-term brand relationships.
- Source: Frontiers in Psychology (2016) — "How Traumatic Violence Permanently Changes Shopping Behavior"; PMC

**Emotional Advertising and Behavior:**
- Highly arousing emotional ads (especially negative) prove most effective at modifying behavior over time, including reducing risky decision-making in specific populations.
- Receptivity varies by individual characteristics and context.
- Source: LSE (emotional roadside advertisements and driving speed)

**What Works in PI Advertising:**
- **95% of purchasing decisions are subconscious** — branding and messaging must trigger emotional responses before rational thought.
- Accident victims navigate trauma, confusion, vulnerability — emotion drives decisions more than reason.
- **Amygdala activation:** Portrayals of pain, injustice, recovery create lasting impressions.
- **Mirror neurons:** Viewers seeing suffering internally simulate it — builds empathy and trust.
- **Dopamine and trust:** Reward-driven messaging ("We'll fight for the compensation you deserve") triggers positive associations.
- **Real stories > stock photos:** Client testimonials and recovery journeys outperform generic visuals; stories processed 22x faster than facts.
- **Calm, honest messaging:** Fear-based and aggressive ads underperform vs. calm, confident messaging focused on clarity and reassurance.
- **Clear process explanation:** "Here's how this works" — consumers don't understand the process; explanation builds trust.
- **Honest tone over hype:** Should sound like a helpful person, not a scripted salesperson.

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Scripted high-pressure messaging
- Exaggerated claims
- Standalone cost-based promises without context

### FOR ED McCABE: The Actual Language Accident Victims Use

**Insurance/Settlement Language:**
- **"Lowball" / "lowballed"** — ubiquitous on Reddit and forums. Example: "Insurance giving me a lowball offer for my car"; "how to deal with a Geico lowball offer auto accident"
- **"They offered" / "they're offering"** — passive construction; insurance as actor.
- **"I'm getting screwed"** — direct from Ask Metafilter: "Someone totaled my car; I'm getting screwed by her insurance company."
- **"Made whole"** — legal doctrine but culturally resonant: "I just want to be made whole" = American sense of fairness. Doctrine: policyholder must be fully compensated before insurer can recover; rooted in equity.
- **"They denied" / "denial"** — Reddit: "Root insurance denying claim"; "Progressive Insurance Denial"; "GEICO Denying Claim"
- **"They're trying to"** — insurance as adversarial agent.

**Reddit/Forum Phrases:**
- "Insurance company is screwing me"
- "They claimed my mom was 'illegally parked'"
- "Dropped from Geico after starting a hit-and-run claim"
- "$750 for pain and med bills. Should I accept?" (Justia)
- "Initial offers covered less than 18% of projected medical costs" (truck victims)
- "I wasn't even in the car" — Geico customer viral TikTok re: mistaken accident report

**Settlement Frustration Language:**
- Total loss: "ACV may be significantly less than their original investment"
- "They will not compensate you for new down payments, taxes, title, registration fees"
- People feel lowballed when ACV < original investment

**Trust Deficit Language:**
- "Insurance companies prioritize minimizing payouts"
- "Adjusters... use specific phrasing to minimize your claim or get you to admit fault"
- "Even innocent statements like 'I'm fine' can later be used as evidence"
- Source: Reddit (r/Insurance, r/legaladvice, r/Car_Insurance_Help), Justia, Metafilter, Pocketsense, Ehlinelaw, The Accident Helpers, Daily Dot (Geico stories)

### FOR JON STEEL: The Claimant's Internal Narrative

**The Cultural Script:**
1. Seek medical attention
2. Call insurance (or receive adjuster's call within hours)
3. Get settlement offer
4. Accept or fight

**The "Call a Lawyer" Moment:**
- Often triggered by a friend: "You should call a lawyer" — standard cultural script reflecting public understanding that insurers minimize payouts.
- The "24-hour rule": Contact attorney *before* insurance — practical wisdom that early statements can be used against you.

**Identity Implications of Calling a Lawyer:**
- "Contacting a personal injury lawyer can feel daunting — sharing accident details and personal information with a stranger may seem terrifying at first." (Gainsberg Law)
- Victims feel "rattled and overwhelmed" while processing what happened.
- Calling a lawyer first = strategic protection; it "protects you" — reframes as self-defense, not aggression.
- Acting quickly is critical — two years from accident to file; evidence deteriorates in 72 hours.

**The Story They Tell Themselves:**
- "I'm not the kind of person who sues" — identity conflict. To seek help = to become someone they've been taught to disapprove of.
- "I just want to be made whole" — fairness frame; not greed, but restoration.
- The "lumping it" default: absorb loss, rely on family/friends, government — avoid the legal system.

**What It Feels Like:**
- Daunting, terrifying (first contact)
- Relief (attorneys "trained to guide... without adding to stress")
- Protection (lawyer as shield against adjuster tactics)

### 1.3 Demographic Reality of Accident Victims

**Who Files Claims (More Likely):**
- Higher BMI (overweight/obese)
- Lower socioeconomic status
- Car crashes (vs. motorcycle)

### 1.4 Class and Race Dimensions

**Racial Bias in PI Compensation:**
- People of color systematically receive **lower compensation** due to race-based data in damage calculations
- Actuarial tables and life expectancy statistics show lower life expectancy and earning potential for Black/Latino vs. white — used to reduce awards
- Injured person of color receives reduced compensation based on race regardless of actual health/qualifications
- Source: BD&J; Nebraska Law Review ("Valuing the Lives of Plaintiffs of Color"); Georgia Law Review ("The Color of Pain")

**Multiple Bias Points:**
- Medical providers underestimate injury severity for Black patients vs. white
- Jurors rely on potentially biased medical opinions for pain/suffering
- Jurors may harbor racial prejudice affecting verdicts

**Class and Economics:**
- Compensation heavily influenced by lost wages and earning potential
- Higher-income professionals receive larger settlements; lower-income workers receive less for identical injuries

- Source: Lake Cumberland Hospital; OU Health; Kevin MD; Mayo Clinic; Premier Health

**Insurance Adjuster First Contact:**
- Typically within **hours** or first **72 hours**
- Deliberate: secure recorded statements early to limit liability before victim gets counsel
- Adjuster performance measured by minimizing payouts; "friendly demeanor" as tactic to extract information
- Legal Reader, Kaine Law, Injury.com, Aikens Law, Bill Connor Law: Provide only basic details; never agree to recording; don't admit fault; seek medical within 72 hours; consider having adjuster contact lawyer

**The "Friend Who Says Call a Lawyer":**
- Standard cultural script
- Reflects widespread understanding that insurers minimize payouts
- Part of "trust deficit" between victims and adjusters

### 1.6 Cultural Scripts

1. **Seek medical** — "I'm fine" trap; document immediately
2. **Call insurance** — or receive adjuster call (often first)
3. **Get settlement offer** — frequently before maximum medical improvement
4. **Accept or fight** — 68% accept first offer without lawyer

## TOPIC 3: Insurance Distrust Map

### 3.1 "Delay, Deny, Defend"

**Origin:**
- **Jay M. Feinman**, Rutgers Law, 2010: *Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It* (Portfolio/Penguin, 256 pp)

**Definition:**
- **Delay:** Prolong claims via bureaucracy; require additional forms; claim forms incorrect — frustrate into abandoning or accepting less
- **Deny:** Reject valid claims or offer far below fair value
- **Defend:** Aggressively litigate rather than honor policy

**Mainstream Awareness:**
- Dec 2024: UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson murdered in Manhattan
- Ammunition inscribed: **"deny," "defend," "depose"** — echoed Feinman's phrase
- Renewed attention to insurance industry practices
- UnitedHealthcare covers 49M Americans; criticism: high prior auth denials (Medicare Advantage), denying breakthrough meds (Alzheimer's, obesity), complicating routine care
- Source: DelayDenyDefend.com; Wikipedia; The Independent; CNBC; People

### 3.2 Documented Insurance Scandals

**Allstate-McKinsey (1990s):**
- McKinsey hired to redesign claims; 12,000+ PowerPoint slides, ~150,000 pages
- Strategy: intentionally low offers; delay to frustrate; "in good hands" for quick settlers, "boxing gloves" for those who contested
- "Alligator approach": prolonged waiting to pressure into inadequate compensation
- Result: $700M saved; profits doubled to $4.6B (2007); bodily injury payouts reduced >20%; paid ~30% below market
- Allstate paid $2.4M fine for withholding documents
- Source: Insurance Claim Hero; Injury Trial Lawyer; Gainservicing

**Colossus (Allstate):**
- Software to evaluate PI claims; reduces values by up to 20%
- Formula-based; undervalues injuries; adjusters control input

**State Farm:**
- Senate hearing 2025: multiple adjuster reassignments; minimizing/excluding damages; pressuring down-coding; unlicensed vendors; undisclosed internal reviewers
- Wind/hail claims reduced up to 50%; $400K damage → $30K payment in one case
- Pioneered claims "redesign" (1979) to "delay, deny and defend"
- Source: Policyholders Lawyers; Oklahoma Watch

**GEICO:**
- 2018: Jury found bad faith, breach of contract, emotional distress — disabled Irvine man; $9.9M general + $13M punitive (~$23M total)
- Six-year dispute; delayed benefits; ignored medical/lost wage requests
- Source: Insurance News Net

**Progressive:**
- Court upheld ruling for bad faith claims handling
- Source: Acente Haber

### 3.4 "Made Whole" — Cultural Meaning

**Legal Doctrine:**
- Equitable principle in all 50 states
- Policyholder must be fully compensated before insurer subrogation
- Prevents insurer from taking settlement $ until policyholder recovered total damages
- Rooted in fairness and equity; "priority-of-payment rule"
- Source: Pocketsense; Ehlinelaw; Davis Kelin; US Legal

### 3.5 Political Culture — Tort Reform

**Traditional Divide:**
- Republicans: restrict lawsuits
- Democrats: broader court access

**Nuance (2015-2018):**
- Republicans increasingly supported private lawsuits — but selectively (anti-abortion, gun rights, religion vs. business regulation)
- Source: Penn Law; Berkeley Law

**Drivers of Reform:**
- Damage caps, shorter deadlines, no-fault
- Predictors: litigation activity (liability losses, lawyer count, tort filings); Republican control; conservative ideology

**Advocates:** Businesses, doctors, insurers, Republicans — "excessive lawsuits harm innovation"  
**Critics:** Plaintiff lawyers, victim advocates, Democrats — "jury trials protect consumers; punitive damages rare"

### 3.6 Insurance Distrust in Specific Communities

**Hispanic:**
- Immigration status barriers; fear of deportation; restricted Medicaid/CHIP eligibility
- Jobs without employer coverage; unaffordable private
- Complex applications; language barriers; limited English proficiency

**Black:**
- Mistrust of U.S. healthcare system and medical research; Tuskegee legacy
- Pew Research (2024): Black Americans and mistrust

**Coverage Gaps (2013-2021):**
- Black-white uninsured gap: 9.9 → 5.3 pts
- Hispanic-white: 25.7 → 16.3 pts
- Medicaid expansion states: better coverage, smaller racial disparities

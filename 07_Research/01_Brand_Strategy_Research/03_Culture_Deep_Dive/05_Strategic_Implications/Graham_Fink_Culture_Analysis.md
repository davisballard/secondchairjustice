## What I'm Looking For: The Image That Doesn't Exist Yet

Culture research tells you what the world looks like. My job is to figure out what the world could look like — specifically, what Second Chair's world looks like when it exists visually. The culture research is the raw material. What I'm building from it is the visual brief that goes into the round table.

Let me start with what already exists, because the zag only makes sense when you know what it's zagging from.

## The Visual Culture of PI Law: What Already Exists

I've looked at the advertising landscape documented in the Category Deep Dive's competitor audit, and I've absorbed the cultural documentation in this session's research. The visual language of PI advertising in the United States in 2026 is one of the most consistent aesthetic monocultures I've encountered in any category:

**What every PI advertisement looks like:**
- **Photography:** Stock car crash imagery (often the same stock photos across multiple vendors), or attorney in a suit pointing at camera, or client and attorney sitting across a desk in posed consultation
- **Color:** Red (urgency, aggression, power), dark navy (authority), white (cleanliness), gold/yellow (prosperity)
- **Typography:** Heavy sans-serif weight, capitals, large point size, often with drop shadow or stroke
- **Composition:** Overcrowded. Phone number in 180pt type. "CALL NOW" in all caps. Multiple competing CTAs. The design principle (if it can be called that) is maximum information per square inch
- **Tone:** Either aggressive urgency (you're missing money RIGHT NOW) or faux-empathy (we care about you, call us, we'll fight for you)

Every vendor looks like every other vendor. The consumer who has seen one PI lead gen ad has seen all PI lead gen ads. The attorney who has seen one PI lead gen vendor presentation has seen all of them.

**This is the creative opportunity stated visually:** The category has so thoroughly converged on the same visual language that any brand making fundamentally different visual choices will appear to have arrived from a different industry entirely.

## The Visual Language I'm Seeing in the Research

### B2B Attorney Visual Culture

The research documents what PI attorneys actually aspire to visually — not in their advertising, but in their physical spaces and their identity markers:

**The "quiet confidence" office aesthetic** documented in Session 01: warm amber tones, residential furnishings in a professional setting, diplomas displayed without crowding, wood rather than chrome, books that have been read rather than books that are decorative. This is the visual language of attorneys who want to communicate trust through understated authority rather than shouted claims.

**The credentialing culture** (Million Dollar Advocates Forum, Super Lawyers) — these credentials have specific visual language: typographic, often with medallion or seal, conservative color palette. Attorneys who display them understand the visual signal: "I belong to a peer community that has verified my standing." This is a different trust signal than mass-market advertising. It is the visual language of belonging within a professional community.

**Ben Crump's visual presence:** Ben Crump's visual identity is notable for what it is not. He is not photographed in front of courthouses or gesturing at cameras. He is photographed in serious, direct-gaze portraits — the visual language of gravity, not performance. The TIME 100 profile used this aesthetic. It communicates: this is someone you'd trust with something that matters.

### B2C Claimant Visual Culture

The accident victim's world at the moment Second Chair's advertising finds them:

**The ER:** Clinical, fluorescent, overwhelming. This is not advertising territory — don't exploit it.

**The "I just want my life back" visual register:** The accident victim's emotional state, documented in the research, is not primarily dramatic. It is exhausted and confused. The person who says "I just want to be made whole" is not experiencing a dramatic moment. They are experiencing the grinding aftermath of something that disrupted their ordinary life. The visual language that matches this emotional reality is ordinary — real rooms, real people, real expressions of quiet concern, not performed distress.

**The misinformation aesthetic** (what to avoid): The viral settlement video aesthetic — cars on highways, dollar amounts in large type, dramatic music, "This woman received $1.2 MILLION" title card — is the visual language of the category's worst behavior. Every visual element that resembles this aesthetic contaminates Second Chair's credibility by association.

## The Specific Visual Codes of Trust in PI Attorney Culture

From the tribal culture research, the visual codes that signal credibility within the PI attorney community specifically:

| Visual Code | What It Signals | Example |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Named photo of a real attorney | Accountability ("this person is real and findable") | JD Supra byline photos, LinkedIn professional portraits |
| Physical location shown | Rootedness ("these people exist in the real world") | Firm website exterior photography |
| Team photo, not posed | Community ("this is a group of people, not a logo") | PILMMA conference photography style |
| Typography that is readable at first glance | Confidence ("we don't need to shout") | The 1986-1994 institutional credibility aesthetic |
| White space | Restraint ("we don't fill every available inch because we don't need to") | Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, American Express annual reports |

The research on adjacent honest brands adds specific visual references:

**Patagonia's visual language:** Product in real environment, real people using it, no lifestyle fantasy. The product earns its own attention without needing a setting that exceeds it. Applied to Second Chair: the advertising earns attention on its own merits without needing a settlement fantasy that it can't deliver.

**Oatly's visual language:** The product IS the design object. Packaging that reads like a person wrote it, with real imperfections (hand-drawn elements, irregular spacing, words that go in unexpected places on the carton). This is the visual language of irreverence within clarity — you know exactly what the product is, and the presentation of that fact is itself the creative act.

## The Visual Zag: What Second Chair Looks Like

Here is the visual brief I'm bringing to the round table:

### For the B2B Brand Identity

**The institutional credibility direction** (from the Adjacent Brands Research) remains correct. Goldman Sachs-era restraint, 1986–1994 typography, warmth within authority. This is the foundation.

**What the culture research adds:**

The warmth has to be more specific than "warm tones." The research on attorney trust signals points to something particular: **humanity at the individual level**. The visual language of trust in PI attorney culture is not the visual language of institutional authority. It is the visual language of a specific person who is accountable to you.

**The visual that captures this:** A Second Chair B2B communication that features a single named human being — not an attorney client (though those exist), but someone from Second Chair who is responsible for what the advertising says. The visual says: this is a real person. Here is their name. If the advertising they promised you is not what arrives, you know exactly who to call.

This is accountability made visual. It is the zag in a category where everything hides behind brand names and vague promises.

### For the B2C Consumer Advertising

This is the harder visual brief. The B2C advertising has to be:
- Different from every other PI ad (all of which look the same)
- Warm and human enough to reach someone in distress
- Honest enough to not create the expectations that undermine the attorney-client relationship

**The visual approach I'm working toward:**

**Ordinary is the point.** The accident victim is in an ordinary situation that has been disrupted. The visual language that reaches them honestly is the visual language of ordinary life — real rooms, real light, real people at kitchen tables or in car dealerships or at desk jobs. Not the highway crash. Not the hospital. The aftermath — the moment of decision that happens in ordinary spaces.

This is the visual zag in the B2C context. Every other PI ad shows the dramatic moment (the crash, the injury). Second Chair shows the consequential moment (the decision, the phone call, the conversation that changes what happens next). The shift from the event to the decision is a visual shift that is simultaneously more honest and more effective — it reaches the person at the moment they have agency, not the moment they were a victim.

**The color palette for B2C:** Away from the category's red/navy/gold. Toward something that feels like a trusted friend's kitchen — warm neutrals, natural light, the visual temperature of a conversation rather than a commercial.

## The Two-World Visual Challenge Hegarty Raised

Hegarty's question in his individual analysis: how do you have a B2B visual identity that is institutional and credible AND a B2C consumer advertising aesthetic that is warm and human? These need to be related without being identical.

**My answer:** They share a common visual principle, not a common aesthetic.

The common principle: **show the real thing.** B2B — show the actual advertising. B2C — show the actual human moment. In both cases, the visual act is exposure rather than performance. The B2B execution of this principle looks institutional (clean typography, named accountability, visible evidence). The B2C execution looks human (ordinary rooms, real faces, the specific moment of decision). The same principle, two different aesthetics, one visual philosophy.

The connecting element between them is **typography.** A distinctive typographic system — the same typeface, the same typographic logic — across both B2B and B2C contexts creates a visual family relationship even when the imagery, color, and tone are different. This is the Oatly lesson: the typeface is the brand, and it can appear in radically different contexts while maintaining recognizability.

## What I'm Bringing to the Round Table

One question for Hegarty: Does the visual execution of "show the advertising" — the concept where the B2C ad runs as the B2B proof — work visually? Or does it require two separate visual systems that are impossible to reconcile?

One question for McCabe: The visual language I'm seeing for the B2C advertising is "ordinary moment, consequential decision." What's the headline that goes on an image of someone at their kitchen table looking at their phone, reading the insurance company's settlement offer?

One provocation for Julian: The culture research has given us "institutional credibility meets human accountability." I want to push back on whether institutional credibility is the right B2B direction, or whether the cultural moment (trust is earned through behavior, not category association) means Second Chair should be less institutional and more confessional. The brand that says "here's our CPSC, here are our clients, here's what the ads actually say" is doing something more radical than institutional credibility. It's doing radical transparency. These have different visual languages.

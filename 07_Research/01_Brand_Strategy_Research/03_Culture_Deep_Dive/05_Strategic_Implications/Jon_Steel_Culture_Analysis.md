## My Method: Finding the Story That's Already There

The job of narrative strategy is not to create a story. It is to find the story that already exists — the one people are living but haven't yet named — and give it language. The brand's job is to name what the audience already knows but can't say.

I've worked through all eight core documents from this session. What follows is what I found.

## The B2B Story: The Gap Between the Attorney's Beginning and Their Supply Chain

Every PI attorney I've read about in this research — the ones who speak at PILMMA, the ones who post on LinkedIn, the ones who gave quotes about "cesspools" and "racing to the phone" — entered the law with a specific reason. Not to win the race-to-the-phone. Not to outsource their lead generation to a vendor running "2025 Compensation Program" ads. Something more particular. Something that usually involves a memory.

The Bryan Stevenson connection the tribal culture research identified is not just an aspirational reference. It is a narrative origin point. These attorneys have a beginning — a case, a client, a moment — when they understood why they were going to do this work. That beginning is often intact. It lives underneath the business complexity, the AI anxiety, the Morgan & Morgan envy. It is the thing that makes the ambulance chaser stigma hurt, because the stigma contradicts the beginning.

**The story Second Chair is inside:**

The attorney's beginning (why they chose plaintiff law) and their current reality (what their supply chain has become) are in conflict. The conflict is not dramatic — it doesn't feel like a crisis. It feels like a low-grade shame, a background awareness that something they're doing doesn't match something they believe. Gary Miles's imposter syndrome research caught the edge of this. The "cesspool" quote caught the edge of it. The attorneys who responded to Ryan McKeen's LinkedIn post at 2 AM were living inside it.

Second Chair is the resolution to this conflict. Not metaphorically — structurally. The advertising that comes from Second Chair is advertising the attorney could show to the client at the beginning of that origin memory. It is consistent with why they started. The supply chain, for the first time, matches the beginning.

**The human story that carries this:**

I'm looking for the specific attorney who can tell this story in their own words. Not a composite. Not a "typical PI attorney." Someone specific. A five-attorney firm in a market where Morgan & Morgan runs 30 spots a week. An attorney whose first case was someone who couldn't afford to fight back. Someone who knows exactly which lead gen ad is running with their name on it, and has specifically not shown it to a client when the client asked "how did you find me?"

That attorney's private moment — the turning away from the question — is the human truth at the center of the B2B story.

## The B2C Story: The Moment Before the Phone Call

The 68% of accident victims who accept the first offer without calling a lawyer are not passive. They are active — they are actively making the decision to absorb the loss. Engel's research documents this: they self-blame, they minimize, they protect their identity as someone who doesn't sue. This is behavioral, not inertial.

The story I'm looking for is the moment before the decision. Not after — not the regret (which is real, and the research documents it: 91% of quick-settlers found their compensation didn't cover long-term medical expenses). The moment before. The specific conversation in the person's head when the adjuster's first offer arrives.

From the Reddit communities, from the forum research, from the cultural language map, I can reconstruct this conversation:

*"I don't want to be difficult. It was an accident — maybe I was partly responsible. The insurance company is being friendly, they're being cooperative. If I call a lawyer this becomes a whole thing. I just want to get through this and get back to my life. I'll probably be fine. I'll accept what they're offering."*

That internal monologue is the story. It is culturally universal across American accident victims who absorb their losses. It is the story of someone who has just made a decision they will regret — not dramatically, not immediately, but in 15 months when the medical bills arrive and the settlement is gone.

**What the B2C advertising must do:**

It must enter that conversation in the moment before the decision. Not after — the moment after is too late. Not in a lecture — the lecture activates defensiveness. It must enter as a voice that sounds like someone who understands why you're about to make that decision, and wants to give you one piece of information first.

The narrative structure is empathy before information. *"I know why you're thinking about just taking what they offered. Before you do, here's what other people in your situation actually received."* The California data (47,300 vs. 13,600) is the information. The empathy is what makes the person hear it.

## The Five Cultural Tensions: Which One Has the Best Story?

The CULTURAL_TENSION_MAP.md identifies five tensions. My job is to tell Julian and the round table which one has the most resonant human story inside it — not the most intellectually interesting tension, but the one where a real person's real experience creates an emotional charge.

**Tension 1: Dignity vs. Transaction**
The strongest story. The attorney who turns away from the client's question "how did you find me?" — that specific moment is a short story that carries the entire positioning. It is specific, it is visual, it is felt. The reader recognizes it because they know their own version of turning away from something they're not proud of. This is the tension with the best story inside it.

**Tension 2: Honesty vs. Exploitation**
Strong conceptually. The human story here is slightly harder to make personal — it requires the audience to feel the connection between misleading advertising and harm to real people. That connection exists (the research documents it clearly) but it takes longer to arrive at emotionally. Better for editorial and content than for 30-second advertising.

**Tension 3: Little Guy vs. Supply Chain**
The most intellectually satisfying tension — the irony of the plaintiff bar's supply chain contradicting its values is genuinely interesting. The problem is that irony is an intellectual response, not an emotional one. This tension works brilliantly as a conference presentation (Hegarty will probably want to use it this way) but it is harder to make emotionally resonant in advertising.

**Tension 4: Scale vs. Soul**
This is a story attorneys already tell themselves. The Morgan & Morgan problem, the "never tried to be the biggest" boutique, the growth-stage firm's squeezed middle — attorneys know this story. The risk is that Second Chair tells them something they already know. The story here is more useful as a framing for the sales conversation than for advertising.

**Tension 5: Speed vs. Trust**
The most commercially specific tension. The story is the race-to-the-phone — the attorney who is the 8th call, the claimant who receives 8 calls. This is vivid, it is specific, it is absurd in a way that advertising can use. But it is a Category story, not yet a Human story. It needs a character at its center — the attorney who stops racing, or the claimant who receives the 8th call and hangs up on all of them.

**My narrative recommendation:** Lead with Tension 1 (Dignity vs. Transaction) as the emotional core. Use Tension 5 (Speed vs. Trust) as the vivid category moment that makes the tension concrete. Use Tension 3 (Little Guy vs. Supply Chain) as the intellectual framework for long-form content and conference conversations.

## The Language That Matters

From the research across attorney forums, LinkedIn, and the cultural documentation, these are the specific phrases that carry real weight — the words attorneys use when they're not performing:

**On their own marketing:**
- "Cesspool" (Darl Champion)
- "Race to the bottom" (Loren Schwartz)
- "Insane" (Ryan McKeen)
- "I would be very careful" — the lawyer's hedge, used by an attorney who knows what's happening but can't name it directly

**On their own identity:**
- "I've won cases worth millions, but I still feel like a fraud waiting to be exposed" (Gary Miles, attorney imposter syndrome research)
- "Fighting spirit"
- "Change lives, restore dignity"

**The claimant's voice:**
- "I just want to be made whole"
- "Lowball"
- "I'm getting screwed"
- "They claimed..."

The gap between the attorney's private language ("cesspool") and their public language ("we're proud to serve our community") is the gap that honest advertising lives in. The brand that speaks the private language — with precision and dignity, not exploitation — is the brand that breaks through.

## The Deprivation Analysis Applied to Culture

In Session 01, the deprivation analysis asked attorneys what they would lose if Second Chair ceased to exist tomorrow. Here I'm asking the parallel question at the cultural level: what has the category taken from PI attorneys that they haven't yet publicly named as lost?

**The answer from the culture research:**

The category has taken the attorney's ability to feel good about how they get their clients. Not just the referral itself (which Session 01 documented), but the sense that their pipeline is an extension of their values — that the way they get cases reflects what they believe about their work.

The attorney who works contingency, fights insurance companies, believes in the constitutional right to civil justice — this attorney is funding their practice through a supply chain that works against the people they claim to protect. They haven't named this as a loss because naming it requires admitting they know it.

Second Chair gives this back. Not as a marketing claim. As a structural fact.

## My Frame: ACT Theory and the Specific Behavior Change Needed

Everything in this research comes back to one question: what behavior do we need to change, who needs to change it, and what is specifically stopping them?

ACT Theory (Action, Connection, Thinking) tells us that behavior change happens through three pathways: making the action itself easier (removing friction), creating the emotional connection that motivates action, or providing the thinking (information, reframing) that shifts the rational calculus. The research has given us both the behaviors to change and the specific barriers preventing them. Let me map them.

## The B2C Behavior Change Problem: Getting the 68% to Call

The single most important behavioral challenge in Second Chair's B2C work: accident victims who should seek legal consultation don't.

**The behavior we need:** Claimant calls Second Chair (or their partnered attorney) before speaking with the insurance adjuster or accepting a settlement offer.

**The specific barriers (from the research):**

### Barrier 1: Identity conflict (Motivation barrier)
*"I'm not the kind of person who sues."*

This is the deepest barrier. Ferrier's framework calls this a **values friction** — the behavior (calling a PI attorney) conflicts with how the person sees themselves. The cultural stigma documents this clearly: the McDonald's coffee case narrative, the "frivolous lawsuit" frame, the >90% lumping-it rate. The claimant who absorbs their loss is not being passive — they are actively protecting their identity as someone who doesn't make a fuss.

**The behavior change strategy:**
Identity-based barriers require identity reframing, not information. The advertising that overcomes this barrier doesn't explain that attorneys are helpful (information). It reframes what calling an attorney means: not "suing" but "protecting what's yours," not "being litigious" but "doing what 100,000 people in the same situation did." The "know your rights" cultural movement has partially done this already — the framing shift from "suing" to "protecting" is underway.

**Second Chair's specific opportunity:** The identity reframe is available because the culture has already begun it. Second Chair's advertising accelerates an existing shift, doesn't originate it. This makes it more believable and less preachy.

### Barrier 2: Overwhelm and decision paralysis (Ability barrier)
*"I don't know what to do first."*

The immediate aftermath of an accident is cognitively overwhelming. The CLAIMANT_CULTURAL_WORLD.md research documents this: medical shock, adjuster calls, financial anxiety, physical pain, medication — all competing for cognitive resources in the 72-hour window when taking action matters most.

In Fogg's Behavior Model terms: the motivation may be present (I want to protect myself) but the ability is compromised (I can't process what I need to do right now).

**The behavior change strategy:**
Reduce the friction of the first action to its absolute minimum. The call to action must be so simple that someone operating under cognitive load can execute it. Not "learn about your rights" (requires cognition). Not "fill out our form" (requires effort). Something closer to: "One call. 10 minutes. We'll tell you what you have."

The "foot in the door" principle (Freedman & Fraser, 1966) is specific here: the first action must be small and reversible. Commitment deepens once the first action is taken. The commitment and consistency effect kicks in after the call, not before it.

### Barrier 3: Distrust of the advertising category (Motivation + Ability barrier)
*"These ads are all lies."*

The insurance distrust map and the TikTok legal education research combine to create a specific problem: the accident victim who has been pre-educated by social media about "1 million dollar verdicts" for fender benders is now suspicious of every PI advertisement they see — because they've been taught (accurately) that legal advertising is often misleading.

This is a trust collapse that makes the motivation to respond and the ability to evaluate credibility both compromised simultaneously.

**The behavior change strategy:**
In Ferrier's ACT framework, the most powerful behavior change in a zero-trust environment is **proof before ask**. Show the thing, don't claim the thing. Second Chair's advertising that makes its own honesty visible — by not making the claims competitors make, by showing what it actually says rather than what it implies — is the behavior change strategy. The absence of the manipulative claim is the proof of the trustworthy claim.

## The B2B Behavior Change Problem: Getting Attorneys Off Bad Vendors

The behavior we need: PI attorney cancels existing (bad) lead gen vendor and signs with Second Chair.

**The behavior we need to change from:** An attorney staying with a lead gen vendor they know is underperforming and possibly embarrassing them because the status quo feels safer than the cost and uncertainty of switching.

**The specific barriers:**

### Barrier 4: Status quo bias (Ability barrier)
*"I know the devil I'm dealing with."*

The research from both Session 01 (consumer) and this session's cultural landscape documents this pattern. PI attorneys who are dissatisfied with their lead gen vendors don't leave — they absorb the dissatisfaction and rationalize it ("at least I know how bad it is"). The Darl Champion "cesspool" quote is from an attorney who is still in the category. The Ryan McKeen LinkedIn post's 60-comment fire was from attorneys who were still buying leads.

**The behavior change strategy:**
The switching cost must be made to feel smaller than the staying cost. Month-to-month terms (no lock-in) directly addresses this by reducing the perceived cost of trying. "Try it for 30 days" with a visible exit removes the commitment that makes the status quo feel safer. This is the Fogg Model's "trigger at the moment of high motivation" principle — the PILMMA conference, the Q1 pipeline anxiety moment, the conversation with a peer who uses Second Chair, are all trigger moments when motivation spikes. The trigger and the friction reduction must coincide.

### Barrier 5: Performance uncertainty (Thinking barrier)
*"How do I know Second Chair's leads will actually convert?"*

The attorney who is evaluating Second Chair is doing a rational calculation: the value of switching (better CPSC, less embarrassing advertising) vs. the risk of switching (new vendor, uncertain results, distraction from casework). The thinking barrier here is uncertainty — the calculation can't be made without performance data.

**The behavior change strategy:**
Transparent performance data is the specific answer to a thinking barrier. Not promises ("we get better results") but proof ("here is our actual CPSC with named clients who will talk to you"). The attorney can now make the calculation. The uncertainty is reduced to verifiable specifics, which is what rational evaluation requires.

### Barrier 6: Professional identity friction (Motivation barrier)
*"Using a lead gen vendor at all feels undignified."*

The tribal culture research surfaces this clearly. The attorney who most acutely feels the ambulance chaser identity wound is also the one who most strongly associates lead gen vendors with the part of their profession they're ashamed of. The behavior change Second Chair needs from this attorney requires overcoming an identity-level motivation barrier — not "this vendor is worse than Second Chair" but "vendors in general are beneath my professional dignity."

**The behavior change strategy:**
The identity must be honored in the pitch, not bypassed. "We help PI attorneys grow their practices in a way they're proud of" is not a feature claim — it is an identity alignment statement. It says: you are the kind of attorney who cares about how you get your cases, not just whether you get them. Second Chair is for attorneys like you. This is the classic "brand as identity signal" mechanism, but applied with surgical precision to a specific professional identity anxiety.

## The Cultural Permission Question

Julian's SECOND_CHAIR_CULTURAL_PURPOSE.md asks: has the culture given Second Chair permission to occupy the honest advertising position, or must it be earned?

**Ferrier's behavioral answer:** The permission exists but is conditional. The condition is speed of proof.

The cultural frustration with lead gen advertising (attorney side) and the cultural distrust of PI advertising (claimant side) both create permission for an honest alternative. The permission is real. But it is conditioned on the honest alternative proving its honesty fast — in the first interaction, not over 12 months of relationship.

Permission that must wait for proof to accumulate is not permission. It is skepticism that has been paused.

**The practical implication:** The first interaction Second Chair has with any potential B2B client must include the proof — the advertising, the named clients, the CPSC data — not a promise to provide it after they sign. The behavior change architecture requires the proof to be front-loaded, not earned.

## The Specific Behavior Change Brief

For the round table, I want to anchor the conversation on two specific behavior changes — not positioning statements, not campaign ideas:

**B2C:** Accident victim who has received an insurance adjuster's first call and hasn't responded yet → calls a Second Chair-affiliated attorney before responding to the adjuster.

**B2B:** PI attorney who is dissatisfied with their current lead gen vendor but hasn't switched → tries Second Chair on a 30-day trial.

Everything in Second Chair's marketing strategy should be evaluated against whether it makes one of those two behaviors more likely. Not whether it is "on brand." Not whether it is "culturally resonant." Whether it makes one of those two specific behaviors more likely for one more person.

## How This Round Table Works

Julian and Jon Steel co-chair. Each agent's individual analysis has been circulated in advance. The round table is not a presentation — it is a collision. Julian has identified the four tensions that need resolution before the work can move to the creative round table:

1. Which of the five cultural tensions is the primary creative entry point?
2. Which level of cultural purpose is the right commitment (Level 1, 2, or 3)?
3. What is the specific behavior change architecture for B2C?
4. Where do Sharp and Binet/Field disagree — and which evidence wins?

---

## Opening: Julian Cole

The individual analyses have given us more alignment than I expected, and one significant disagreement I want to surface immediately.

The alignment: everyone agrees the cultural territory is real, the tensions are documented, and the honest advertising position is structurally defensible. Nobody is arguing against the basic direction.

The disagreement: Sharp and Binet/Field have different views on whether purpose-led positioning is the right strategic instrument for a brand at Second Chair's stage of development. Sharp's analysis suggests the brand should build distinctive assets and CEP linkages, with purpose as secondary. Binet/Field's analysis suggests that strong purpose is actually the most commercially effective path — but only if it's genuine.

I want to resolve that disagreement before we leave this room. Byron — would you like to go first?

---

## Byron Sharp — Opening Position

Yes. And I want to be precise about my concern, because I think Binet/Field and I are actually closer than Julian's framing suggests.

My concern is not that purpose doesn't work. The IPA evidence on strong purpose is compelling. My concern is sequencing. Purpose-led positioning requires an audience that already has some memory structure for the brand. You cannot build mental availability through purpose alone from a standing start. The sequence matters:

Phase 1: Build recognition. Get the distinctive assets out there consistently. Establish "Second Chair = honest PI leads" in the memory structures of enough attorneys to matter.

Phase 2: Build meaning. Once the brand exists in memory, layer in the purpose positioning. The cultural resonance compounds when it attaches to an existing memory structure.

If Second Chair tries to lead with Level 3 purpose (restoring the profession's integrity) before enough attorneys know what Second Chair is, the purpose narrative will travel through cultural channels that don't reach enough of the target audience to convert.

---

## Les Binet — Response to Sharp

I want to be fair to Byron's position because he's not wrong about sequencing in general. But I think he's misread the specific situation here.

The IPA evidence on strong purpose includes brands that launched with purpose from day one — not brands that built recognition first and added purpose later. Oatly didn't build oat milk recognition and then add their environmental and irreverent positioning. The positioning was the recognition-builder from the beginning.

The reason this works: purpose-led positioning generates earned media, word-of-mouth, and peer conversation that awareness advertising cannot replicate at the same cost. For Second Chair, whose distribution challenge is reaching PI attorneys who aren't already aware of the brand, the purpose positioning IS the distribution strategy. The attorneys who discover Second Chair's honest advertising position will tell other attorneys. The earned conversation is the reach-builder.

The IPA evidence supports this: purpose campaigns show 2.1 very large business effects even when controlling for media budget. The compounding effect of peer conversation is a significant part of that mechanism.

---

## Byron Sharp — Partial Concession

Peter Field's evidence is solid and I'm not disputing the IPA data. The point I'll hold is this: the distinctive assets must be built *simultaneously* with the purpose narrative, not sequentially. If Second Chair's purpose is "honest advertising" and the only distinctive asset is the verbal claim "we're honest," the brand has nothing distinctive when the claim is copied.

The commitment I want from this room: Second Chair's visual and verbal assets are defined and protected before the purpose-led campaign launches. The assets must be as consistent as the purpose.

---

## Jon Steel — Interjection

Both of you are talking about the brand as if the primary problem is recognition or effectiveness science. The primary problem is narrative. You can have the most distinctive assets in the category and the clearest purpose positioning, and still produce advertising that doesn't say anything.

The narrative question is: what is the story? Not the positioning. Not the assets. The story.

I've been sitting with this research for a week, and the story I can see is Tension 1 — the attorney who turns away from the client's question. That is the story. The character is real. The moment is specific. The emotion is shame and resolution simultaneously. The brand is not in the story as a logo. It is in the story as the reason the attorney doesn't have to turn away anymore.

That story will carry the brand further than any distinctive asset system, because it is the emotional truth at the center of everything else.

---

## Richard Shotton — On the Behavioral Mechanics of the Story

Jon is right that the story is the central vehicle. I want to add the behavioral mechanism that makes it work:

The pratfall effect — admitting a weakness to build credibility — combined with the social norm violation that an honest brand creates in a dishonest category — produces a very specific response in the audience that receives it. It creates dissonance. The attorney who reads the story of the attorney turning away from the client's question experiences a flicker of recognition: *"I've done that. Or I've felt that I would do that."*

That dissonance resolves in one of two ways: the attorney minimizes ("not my situation") or they seek the resolution Second Chair offers. The advertising's job is to make the resolution more compelling than the minimization. Ferrier's behavior change architecture — reducing the friction of the first action, making the trial feel low-risk — is what converts the dissonance into a call.

---

## Adam Ferrier — On the Specific Behavior Change

I want to add precision to what the story is supposed to accomplish behaviorally, because it affects what the story says.

The behavior Second Chair needs is: attorney cancels their current vendor and tries Second Chair on a 30-day trial. The story Jon is describing creates the motivation to change. But motivation without a clear, low-friction action path doesn't convert into behavior.

The advertising has to do both things in the same space: tell the story (create motivation) AND make the first action feel safe and small (reduce friction). If the story is doing its job — creating the dissonance of recognition — the call to action must immediately offer the escape hatch: "Try for 30 days. No lock-in. We'll show you the advertising before you commit."

The story is the charge. The month-to-month trial is the discharge. Both have to be present or the emotional energy dissipates without conversion.

---

## Julian Cole — Steering Toward Resolution on Tension Question

We're converging on some things. Let me name what I'm hearing:

1. The purpose positioning is the right strategic direction, and the IPA evidence supports it as a growth mechanism for Second Chair specifically (Binet/Field won the Sharp debate on sequencing, with Sharp's concession on simultaneous asset building)
2. Jon's Tension 1 (Dignity vs. Transaction) is the primary narrative entry point, with Tension 3 (Little Guy vs. Supply Chain) as the intellectual frame
3. The behavior change architecture (Ferrier) must be built into the advertising execution — the story and the action path in the same space
4. Shotton's pratfall approach (admit the category's problem, offer the resolution) is the specific persuasion technique

The remaining question for this room: **Level 2 or Level 3 purpose?**

---

## Nigel Bogle — Commercial Test of Level 2 vs. Level 3

This is the commercial test I'd apply: which purpose level is the one an attorney will retell to another attorney?

Level 1 ("The vendor attorneys can be proud of") — an attorney might retell this, but it's product description. It's not a conversation starter.

Level 2 ("Honest advertising as reform") — an attorney would retell this. "I found this lead gen company that actually runs honest advertising to accident victims — not the '2025 Compensation Program' bullshit. They show you the ads before you sign." This is a sentence someone says at a PILMMA lunch.

Level 3 ("Restoring the profession's integrity") — this is the marketing version, not the conversation version. Nobody at a PILMMA lunch says "I found a vendor that is restoring the profession's integrity." They say the Level 2 version.

My commercial recommendation: **Level 3 as the brand's internal purpose; Level 2 as the external expression.** The brand believes it is restoring something. It communicates this through the Level 2 language that is actually conversationally repeatable.

---

## Peter Field — IPA Support for Nigel's Position

The IPA evidence actually supports Nigel's precise distinction. The purpose-led brands that achieved 2.1 very large business effects operated at what he's calling Level 3 internally (Patagonia's ownership transfer, Oatly's climate transparency) while communicating in language that was specific and repeatable at Level 2. "Don't Buy This Jacket" is Level 2 language for a Level 3 purpose. It's specific, memorable, and contains the irony that makes it shareable.

Second Chair's Level 3 internal purpose ("restoring the integrity of the supply chain between attorneys and injured people") expressed in Level 2 external language ("leads that come from advertising you'd show to your clients") is exactly this pattern.

---

## Julian Cole — Synthesis and Decisions

Three decisions made in this room, to be taken to the creative round table:

**Decision 1: The cultural tension that leads is Tension 1 (Dignity vs. Transaction) with Tension 3 (Little Guy vs. Supply Chain) as the intellectual architecture.**
Jon's narrative evidence and Shotton's behavioral evidence both support Tension 1 as the emotional entry point. Tension 3 provides the category critique that makes the positioning coherent.

**Decision 2: Level 3 internal purpose, Level 2 external language.**
Nigel's commercial test wins. The brand believes it is restoring something. It says it through repeatable, specific, behavior-focused language.

**Decision 3: The advertising execution must include both the story and the low-friction action path in the same communication.**
Ferrier's behavior change requirement is non-negotiable. The story without the action path is awareness advertising. The action path without the story is direct response. Both are weaker than the combination.

The creative round table's challenge: make the decision above brave, surprising, and specific. Take the Level 2 language and make it the kind of thing Hegarty wants to produce. That is Ed McCabe and Graham Fink's job.

---

## Jon Steel — Closing Note

One thing I want the creative team to have when they walk into their round table:

The specific words that PI attorneys use when they're being honest with themselves about their lead gen situation. "Cesspool." "Race to the bottom." "Insane." These words came from real attorneys in real conversations. The advertising that uses this register — without manufacturing it, without performing it — is the advertising that will be recognized as coming from inside the tribe.

The creative team doesn't have to use these words. But they need to know these words exist, to understand what register the advertising needs to inhabit.

The brief I'm giving Hegarty: *speak the private language.*

## Calibration: What We Bring to Culture Research

Our role is not to evaluate whether the cultural analysis is correct — Julian and the team are better placed than we are to assess cultural accuracy. Our role is to assess whether the cultural territory identified leads to advertising effectiveness, and to provide the IPA evidence that should inform how Second Chair's cultural positioning is executed.

The crucial question: does the purpose-led positioning Julian is proposing produce meaningful business effects, or does it produce PR buzz with minimal commercial impact?

The answer, from the IPA data, is highly conditional. And the condition matters enormously for what Second Chair does next.

## The IPA Evidence on Purpose-Led Brands

### Peter Field's "Effective on Purpose" (2021)

Our 2021 analysis of the IPA Databank compared 47 purpose-driven campaigns against 333 non-purpose campaigns:

**Overall result, pooled:** Purpose cases averaged 1.1 "very large business effects" vs. 1.6 for non-purpose. At first glance, purpose performs worse.

**The critical distinction — strong vs. weak purpose:**

| Purpose Type | Very Large Business Effects | Customer Acquisition | Market Share Growth |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Strong purpose (57% of cases) | **2.1** | **50%** | **41%** |
| Weak purpose (43% of cases) | **0.1** | **5%** | **0%** |
| Non-purpose average | 1.6 | 30% | 26% |

**What determines strong vs. weak purpose?**

Strong purpose has three characteristics that weak purpose lacks:

1. **Genuine integration:** The purpose is not a marketing campaign. It is embedded in the company's operating model, products, and behavior. Patagonia's environmental purpose is in its financial structure. HubSpot's inbound purpose is in its entire product and business model.

2. **Cultural relevance:** The purpose connects to something society genuinely cares about — not a brand-manufactured concern, but a genuine cultural tension or movement.

3. **Demonstrated, not claimed:** The brand shows the purpose through behavior, not through advertising assertions about the purpose.

**Second Chair's specific situation:** On all three dimensions, Second Chair's honest advertising purpose qualifies as strong purpose, not weak:

1. The purpose is structurally integrated — Second Chair's revenue model (CPSC measurement, not CPL) requires honest advertising to work
2. The purpose connects to documented cultural tensions (attorney shame about lead gen, claimant exploitation through misleading advertising)
3. The purpose is demonstrated by showing the advertising — this is proof, not claim

**Our verdict:** The IPA evidence strongly supports Second Chair's cultural purpose positioning — provided it is executed as strong purpose (structural, demonstrated, culturally connected) rather than weak purpose (advertising assertion without behavioral proof).

## The IPA Evidence on Trust-Building Advertising

From the IPA Databank "Investing in Trust" analysis (2024, 812 campaigns, 103 with very large trust increases):

- **93%** of campaigns with very large trust increases report at least one very large business effect vs. **66%** across all campaigns
- Trust-building campaigns show **27 percentage points more** very large business effects
- **Customer acquisition:** 39% of trust campaigns vs. 28% of average campaigns
- **Sales volume:** 39% vs. 25%
- **Market share:** 34% vs. 26%
- **Brand quality perceptions:** 59% vs. 20%

**The specific trust-building mechanism relevant to Second Chair:**

The IPA research identifies that trust-building campaigns work when they create "earned trust" — trust derived from demonstrated behavior, not marketing claims. The three highest-performing trust mechanisms:

1. **Proof of product claim** (the advertising is shown before commitment is required)
2. **Named social proof** (specific, verifiable advocates, not anonymous testimonials)
3. **Transparent business practices** (pricing visible, terms clear, metrics published)

Second Chair's proposed proof mechanisms — visible advertising, named clients, published CPSC data, month-to-month terms — map precisely onto the three highest-performing trust mechanisms in the IPA evidence. This is not coincidence. These are structurally the behaviors that build commercial trust, and they happen to align with Second Chair's honest advertising positioning.

## The B2B Emotional Effectiveness Evidence

A common objection to emotional/purpose-led positioning in B2B is that B2B buyers are rational and respond to product specifications, not emotional narratives. The IPA evidence contradicts this:

| Brand | Strategy | IPA Measured Results |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| BT Business Broadband | Emotional "better connections lead to better business" | £29M incremental sales; £14.5M net profit; £3.16 ROMI per £1 |
| Xero (accounting software) | Humor + empathy vs. feature competition | £4.07 gross profit per £1 marketing investment |
| Autodesk | Emotional storytelling | 14% site traffic increase post-campaign |

**The IPA B2B finding:** Emotional B2B campaigns deliver **greater long-term profits, market share, and loyalty** than product-focused approaches. The mechanism: B2B buyers are humans making decisions that affect their professional identity, not pure rational agents evaluating specifications. The emotional layer of a B2B purchase decision — "do I trust this vendor? will this make me look smart or foolish? does this align with my professional identity?" — is significant, and brand investment in that emotional layer produces compounding returns.

For PI attorneys — whose professional identity is particularly freighted (the ambulance chaser stigma, the PILMMA entrepreneur vs. constitutional champion tension, the imposter syndrome documented in the research) — the emotional layer of the vendor relationship is unusually significant. The B2B emotional effectiveness evidence applies with particular force here.

## The Fame Multiplier: Why Cultural Resonance Produces Commercial Returns

Our research with the IPA Databank has repeatedly confirmed: campaigns that achieve **fame** — that generate cultural conversation, earned media, and peer sharing beyond paid reach — dramatically outperform campaigns that achieve only awareness. Fame campaigns produce 4x the business effects of awareness campaigns.

The mechanism: fame campaigns build mental availability across the entire potential customer base through channels that paid advertising cannot reach. When an attorney tells another attorney about Second Chair, that conversation activates a Category Entry Point without costing Second Chair a media dollar.

**The cultural triggers that could produce fame for Second Chair:**

1. **"We'll show you the advertising"** — in a category where no vendor will show their advertising, this single behavioral differentiator is inherently shareable. Attorneys who discover it will tell other attorneys.

2. **The cultural purpose positioning** — "PI lead gen doesn't have to exploit injured people" is a conversation-worthy position that will get picked up by legal marketing trade press, PILMMA speakers, and attorney LinkedIn communities.

3. **The CPSC proof mechanism** — publishing actual cost-per-signed-case data (which no other vendor does) will generate earned media in the PI marketing conversation.

None of these fame triggers require paid amplification to work. They require the behaviors to be genuine (structural, not claimed) and to be made visible to the audience that will spread them.

## Our Efficiency Warning: 60/40 Still Applies

The cultural purpose positioning is brand-building work — System 1, emotional, long-term. It builds the memory structures that allow Second Chair to be considered in the future.

But Second Chair also needs near-term revenue from the attorneys who are ready to buy now. The 60/40 principle (60% brand, 40% activation) is the evidence-based starting point — not the rule for every situation, but the starting hypothesis.

For an early-stage B2B brand like Second Chair:
- The activation ratio probably skews higher than 40% — the immediate revenue need is real
- The brand building cannot be abandoned even when activation pressure increases — the long-term compounding effects only accrue with consistent investment
- The specific activation mechanics (foot-in-the-door trials, CPSC comparison calculators, PILMMA presence) should be funded without cannibalizing the brand investment

**Our practical recommendation:** Begin with a 50/50 split between brand (purpose positioning, cultural resonance, named client stories) and activation (trial offers, CEP-specific campaigns, direct outreach to attorneys in disruption moments). As the brand builds recognition and memory structures, gradually shift toward the 60/40 benchmark.

# Culture Round Table — Creative Team
## Where creative direction begins to crystallize.

**Participants:** John Hegarty (chair, Executive Creative Director), Ed McCabe (Senior Copywriter), Graham Fink (Senior Art Director)
**Observers:** Julian Cole (Strategy), Jon Steel (Narrative — co-chair for handover)
**Date:** February 2026
**Session:** 03 — Culture Deep Dive / Round Table 2 of 2
**Input:** All individual agent analyses; Strategy Round Table decisions (3 decisions)

---

## Setup: Jon Steel's Handover

Jon Steel opens the creative round table with the three strategy decisions and one brief for the creative team:

**The three decisions from the strategy round table:**
1. Cultural tension that leads: Tension 1 (Dignity vs. Transaction), framed by Tension 3 (Little Guy vs. Supply Chain)
2. Purpose level: Level 3 internal, Level 2 external language
3. Advertising execution must carry both the story AND the low-friction action path simultaneously

**The brief from Jon Steel:** *Speak the private language.*

PI attorneys have a private register — "cesspool," "race to the bottom," "insane" — that they use about their lead gen situation when they're being honest. They have a public register — "we fight for you," "change lives, restore dignity" — that they use in public. The advertising that reaches them has to speak the private language, because that is the register where trust lives.

Jon Steel exits. Julian Cole stays as observer. The creative team takes over.

## John Hegarty — Opening the Creative Round Table

Right. I've read everything. I've read the strategy round table. I have three reactions and then I want to hear Ed and Graham.

**Reaction 1:** The strategy round table got to the right answer on tension, purpose, and behavior change architecture. The decisions are sound. That's not always the case. Now the question is whether we can find creative work that makes those decisions earn the attention of a PI attorney who has seen every kind of advertising since they got their JD.

**Reaction 2:** "Speak the private language" is the right brief from Steel. But I want to push it one step further. The private language isn't just what they say about their vendors. It's what they say about their own work — about why they got into this. "I just want to fight for people who can't fight for themselves." That's the beginning. And the advertising that makes the connection between that beginning and the supply chain that contradicts it — without moralizing, without lecturing, just by making the connection visible — is the advertising that can't be ignored.

**Reaction 3:** Fink raised a provocation in his individual analysis that I think deserves airtime before we settle on visual direction. He asked whether "institutional credibility" is the right visual register, or whether "radical transparency" is a visually different thing. I want that answered in this room before we leave.

Ed — start with the verbal territory. What do you have?

## Ed McCabe — Verbal Territory

I've been working on compression since my individual analysis. Let me show you where I've landed.

The one-word brief is **"proud."** That's the organizing principle. The question everything else answers is: "Is this the kind of practice you're proud of?"

But "proud" by itself is too earnest. Hegarty is right that the private language is what we need. So let me put both together:

**The B2B headline I keep coming back to:**

*"How you get your clients is part of who you are."*

Seven words. No question mark. No exclamation. No promise. No threat. Just a statement that every PI attorney who reads it either recognizes immediately or dismisses immediately — and the ones who recognize it are Second Chair's clients.

**Why this line works:**
- It doesn't mention lead generation
- It doesn't mention dishonest advertising
- It doesn't mention Second Chair at all (until the logo)
- It makes the connection between professional identity and business practice without lecturing
- The attorney who reads it and thinks "that's true and my current vendor doesn't reflect it" has just made the judgment themselves. We didn't make it for them.

This is the Oatly principle applied: don't tell them the dairy industry is wrong. Let the contrast do the work.

**The B2C headline:**

*"Before you accept what they're offering — talk to someone whose job is to tell you what it's actually worth."*

This is the anti-settlement-fantasy headline. It doesn't promise millions. It promises an honest assessment. The accident victim who has been pre-educated by TikTok lawyers will recognize this as the thing they actually need — not a settlement calculator, but a real person telling them the truth about their situation.

**The alternative B2C line (shorter):**

*"They made their first offer. Make one call before you answer."*

This is the urgency version — specifically timed to the moment right after the adjuster's first contact. It's a news-headline format: one thing has happened, one action is available. The simplicity works for a target audience that is operating under cognitive load.

## Graham Fink — Visual Territory

Before I answer Hegarty's question about institutional credibility vs. radical transparency, let me show you the visual problem in concrete terms.

Two images exist in my mind from the research:

**Image 1 (the category):** A PI attorney standing in front of their office, in a suit, arms crossed, looking directly at camera. Red background. Phone number in 180pt type. "CALL NOW." Every PI ad that has ever run.

**Image 2 (Second Chair's zag):** A screenshot of an ad. Not an ad inside a creative mockup. An actual screenshot — the way you'd screenshot something on your phone to share with someone. The ad is simple, honest, human. The caption reads: "This is one of the ads that generated the leads you're evaluating. Here's the CPSC it produced."

The second image is the visual idea that comes from the strategy. It is simultaneously the B2B proof mechanism, the visual brand differentiator, and the creative execution. It doesn't require illustration. It doesn't require a photoshoot. It requires that the B2C advertising be good enough to show.

**On Hegarty's question — institutional credibility vs. radical transparency:**

These are not mutually exclusive visual registers. They share a common grammar: restraint. Goldman Sachs is restrained because it doesn't need to shout. The radical transparency execution (showing the actual ad, showing the actual CPSC number, naming the actual client) is restrained because it trusts the evidence to do the work.

The visual difference between them is tone: institutional credibility is formal (serif type, conservative palette, authority signals), radical transparency is matter-of-fact (functional typography, readable on first pass, no decorative elements that would distract from the content).

**My recommendation:** Second Chair's brand identity uses the institutional credibility grammar (formal, authoritative, credible at first glance) as the container. Inside that container, what it reveals is radical — the actual advertising, the actual data, the actual named clients. The surprise is that the formal container holds genuinely transparent content. The tension between the formal exterior and the radically honest interior is itself a visual communication.

## John Hegarty — Responding to McCabe

"How you get your clients is part of who you are." I like this. I want to push it.

The version that makes me uncomfortable (which is the version I want) is slightly more specific. Something closer to:

*"You'd never settle a case you weren't proud of. Why are you settling for leads?"*

This is more uncomfortable because it uses the attorney's own vocabulary ("settle") in a context they haven't heard it before. The lateral move — taking a word from their professional world and applying it to their vendor relationship — is the kind of verbal judo that makes people stop.

McCabe — does "settling for leads" work, or is it too clever?

---

## Ed McCabe — On Hegarty's Suggestion

It's almost right. "Settling for leads" is good. The problem is that "settling" in common usage means "accepting less than you wanted" — which is right — but it also echoes "settlement" (the legal term), which is the lateral move you want. Both meanings work simultaneously.

The version I'd take to a brief:

*"You've never settled a case you weren't proud of. But are you settling for leads?"*

The first sentence earns the credibility to ask the second sentence. The attorney nods to the first (true, accurate, recognizes their professional standards). The second sentence recontextualizes what they've just nodded to and makes them uncomfortable.

That discomfort is Shotton's pratfall effect in action. The first sentence establishes competence. The second sentence exposes the inconsistency. The resolution is Second Chair.

---

## Graham Fink — The Visual That Goes With That Line

If the headline is "You've never settled a case you weren't proud of. But are you settling for leads?" — the visual is not an attorney looking at camera.

The visual is the attorney not looking at camera. Reading something. Their face is concentrated, slightly troubled. In the foreground, slightly out of focus, a screen or a printout — the viewer can't quite read what it is, but the body language tells everything.

The viewer infers: the attorney is looking at their lead gen advertising and feeling the headline.

You never see the advertising. You see the attorney's face seeing it. The most powerful communication of "this advertising is embarrassing" is not showing the embarrassing advertising. It is showing the attorney's face while they look at it.

This is the visual zag: in a category where every ad shouts at you, Second Chair shows you someone reading quietly. And in their face, you see everything.

---

## John Hegarty — The B2C Creative Position

I want to make sure we have a clear creative direction for B2C before we close, because it's the harder brief.

The B2C advertising has to accomplish something no other advertising in this category accomplishes: reach a person in distress and tell them the truth instead of a fantasy. The creative challenge is that telling the truth sounds boring. "We'll give you an honest assessment" is not a headline that wins awards or gets clicked.

The way to make honesty interesting is specificity. The specific truth is more interesting than the general honesty claim.

**The B2C creative direction I'm committed to:**

Specific data. Specific people. Specific outcomes. Not "you could receive compensation." Specific: "In California, accident victims who talked to a lawyer before accepting the first offer received $47,300 on average. Those who didn't: $13,600. Same injuries."

That specific truth is more compelling than any settlement fantasy, because it is verifiable. The accident victim who has been pre-educated to distrust PI advertising can verify this. And verified truth — truth they checked — is infinitely more powerful than claimed truth.

The creative frame: **the most interesting thing we can show an accident victim is the truth about their situation.** Not a character testifying. Not a dramatic reenactment. A fact that is so specific and so different from what they've been told by the category that it stops them.

---

## Ed McCabe — The One Line I Want to Leave the Room With

For both the B2B and B2C creative direction, I want to leave the creative round table with one unifying thought:

**The brand's promise is not "we'll get you more." The brand's promise is "we'll tell you the truth."**

For B2B attorneys: "We'll run advertising that tells accident victims the truth about what PI attorneys can do for them."

For B2C claimants: "We'll tell you what your situation is actually worth before you accept less."

In both cases, the promise is honesty rather than abundance. This is the inversion that defines Second Chair against every competitor in the category — all of whom promise more. Second Chair promises truth. And truth, delivered credibly and specifically, is worth more than any fantasy.

---

## John Hegarty — Closing the Creative Round Table

Three creative commitments I'm taking from this room to the fusion phase:

**1. The lead headline (B2B):** "You've never settled a case you weren't proud of. But are you settling for leads?" — McCabe develops this further with Shotton's feedback on the pratfall structure.

**2. The visual concept (B2B):** The attorney's face while reading — not the advertising, not the data, but the human response to seeing the truth. Fink develops this with Graham's institutional credibility × radical transparency grammar.

**3. The B2C creative frame:** Specific data as the creative device. The California $47,300/$13,600 fact — or its equivalent — presented without editorial, without promise amplification, as simply the most interesting thing Second Chair can show an accident victim.

One more thing. Nigel Bogle's commercial test from the strategy round table: which purpose level produces a sentence an attorney will repeat to another attorney at PILMMA? I want to add the creative version of that test: **which advertisement is the one an attorney shows another attorney unprompted?**

That is the brief. That is the measure. The advertising that travels through the community without paid media behind it — because it says something so recognizably true that sharing it feels like a gift — is the advertising we are trying to make.

Everything else in this research is context. That is the goal.

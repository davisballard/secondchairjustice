## First: What I'm Not Going to Say

I'm not going to say the cultural territory is "interesting" or "promising." These are the words people use when they mean "I can see the strategy but I can't see the idea." The culture research Julian's team has produced is genuinely good — better than most I've read for a legal category brief. But good cultural research is not a creative idea. My job here is to find the creative idea that the cultural research makes possible — and to be honest about what I can see and what I can't yet.

## The "Zag" Test: What Would Make This Work Nobody Else Would Run?

The most important question in creative strategy is not "what is true?" It is "what is true AND unexpected?" Truth alone is not enough. There are thousands of things that are true about PI attorneys and accident victims. Most of them would produce advertising that is indistinguishable from the advertising that already exists.

The "zag" test: if you removed the Second Chair logo from the advertising and replaced it with any competitor's logo, would the advertising still work? If yes, it's not distinctive enough. If no — if the advertising only makes sense coming from Second Chair — you've found the zag.

Let me run this test against the cultural territory Julian's team has identified.

## Which of the Five Tensions Is Brave Enough?

### Tension 1: Dignity vs. Transaction

Jon Steel nominated this one as the strongest narrative. He's right that the human story is there — the attorney who turns away from the client's question "how did you find me?" is a genuine moment.

**Is it brave enough?** It could be. The advertising that shows an attorney in that moment — and then shows Second Chair as the solution — is advertising that makes attorneys uncomfortable before it makes them comfortable. Uncomfortable advertising is memorable advertising.

**The risk:** Sentimentality. The advertising that "honors the attorney's dignity" has a gravitational pull toward earnestness that kills it. You need a writer who can find the edge of that moment without making it glow.

**My provisional verdict:** Yes, with the right execution. The story is real. The question is whether McCabe can find the language that makes it cut rather than comfort.

### Tension 3: The Little Guy vs. The Little Guy's Supply Chain

This is the one I keep coming back to.

The PI attorney spends their career being David — fighting insurance companies, corporate defendants, institutional power. They are the underdog's champion. And their marketing supply chain — the vendor generating their leads — is run by people using the same playbook as the defendants they spend their careers opposing.

The irony is perfect. And perfect irony, in the right hands, doesn't need to lecture. It just needs to be made visible.

**Is it brave enough?** Yes. This is the tension that produces advertising that makes someone put down their coffee. "The attorneys who fight for the little guy are getting screwed by their vendors just like the little guy they fight for." That is a thought that doesn't require explanation. It lands.

**The risk:** Preachiness. Irony handled badly becomes moralizing. The execution has to be dry, specific, and completely devoid of self-congratulation. The brand makes the observation and gets out of the way.

**My provisional verdict:** This is the braver territory. Tension 1 is the more emotional story. Tension 3 is the more conceptually precise position. The strongest campaign probably uses Tension 3 as the intellectual frame and Tension 1 as the emotional human story inside it.

### Tension 2: Honesty vs. Exploitation

This is the most virtuous-sounding tension, which is precisely why I'm most suspicious of it.

"Honest in a dishonest industry" is a real position. Oatly does it, and it works because they find the absurdity in the industry's dishonesty rather than the virtue in their own honesty. The moment you start congratulating yourself for being honest, you've lost. Because nobody trusts a brand that says "we're the honest one." They trust a brand that shows them something and lets them draw the conclusion.

**Is it brave enough?** It can be, with the right execution. The advertising that shows the category's behavior (without naming it) and then contrasts it with Second Chair's behavior (without claiming it) — just two images, two facts, no moral instruction — can carry this tension.

**The risk:** Everything. "Honest in a dishonest industry" is either the best idea in the room or the most self-righteous. There is no middle ground. The execution has to be perfect.

**My provisional verdict:** This tension is the backup position if we can't find the right execution for Tensions 1 and 3. It's available, but it's higher-risk.

## The Creative Opportunity I'm Most Interested In

Here's what I want to bring to the round table:

**The concept of "showing the work."**

Every other PI lead gen vendor in this category treats their advertising as proprietary — as if showing what they run would expose something embarrassing (it would). Second Chair's position is that you show the advertising. This is not just a proof mechanism. It is a creative idea.

The brand that publishes its advertising before the sale is the brand that has nothing to hide. In a category where everything is hidden — pricing, methodology, advertising quality, actual CPSC results — the brand that publishes everything is doing something that no brief could have imagined because it requires a business model structured to make it possible.

**The creative idea:**
An ad for Second Chair that is simply a Second Chair ad. A B2C claimant ad, running as a B2B industry trade ad. The copy: "Here's what the leads you're buying from us come from." No pitch beyond that. The work is the pitch.

This concept can only come from Second Chair. It cannot be borrowed by any competitor. It is the zag.

## The Visual Territory I'm Not Yet Sure About

The Adjacent Brands Research established the institutional credibility direction: Goldman Sachs-era restraint, 1986–1994 typography, warmth-within-authority. This is the right directional read for Second Chair's B2B visual identity.

But culture research opens a question I want Fink to answer: what does the honest advertising look like when it's the B2C ad, not the B2B brand? The B2C advertising — the actual ads that accident victims see — has to be different from the B2B brand identity. It has to be warm, human, and specific in a way that institutional credibility doesn't automatically produce.

The most interesting visual challenge for Second Chair is not the brand identity (which I think we can see). It's the two-world problem: a B2B brand that is institutional and credible, running B2C advertising that is warm and honest. These two aesthetics have to be related without being identical.

Fink's job at the round table is to show us what that looks like.

## What I'll Push Back on at the Round Table

**Against Julian:** Level 3 purpose (restoring the profession's integrity) is right as a strategic destination. But "restoring" is a word that implies something that existed before. I want to know: was there a moment when PI advertising was honest? I doubt it. So the word we want is not "restoring" — it's "establishing for the first time." Second Chair isn't restoring something. It's inventing something the category has never had.

**Against Sharp:** I disagree that the Cards Against Humanity case proves that PR moments without consistent asset building are ineffective. I think the issue with CAH is that their brand is the stunt — the stunt IS the asset. For Second Chair, the "showing the work" concept is not a stunt. It is a structural behavior that can be executed consistently in every touchpoint. The asset is not the campaign. The asset is the behavior of showing.

**Against the research generally:** The cultural research has done an excellent job identifying what's wrong with the category. It has done a less complete job identifying what's aspirationally right — what PI attorneys want the profession to look like, not just what they're ashamed of. I want the round table to spend 20 minutes on that question before we get to positioning options.

## My One Commitment for the Round Table

The advertising that wins in this category will be advertising that PI attorneys share with other PI attorneys before they've even spoken to a Second Chair salesperson. It will travel through the community not because it is viral, but because it says something that every attorney recognizes but has never seen said out loud.

That is the brief. The cultural research has found the territory. Now I need McCabe and Fink in the room to find the idea.

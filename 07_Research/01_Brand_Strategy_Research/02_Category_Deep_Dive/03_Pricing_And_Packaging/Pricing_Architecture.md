## Overview

Pricing in this category is one of the most strategically significant structural facts. Of 37 vendors researched, only 13 publish any pricing publicly. The majority force full sales engagement before a dollar figure is disclosed. This document maps everything that's knowable — and identifies what the opacity itself signals.

## Tier-by-Tier Pricing Breakdown

### Tier 1A: Directory / Profile Advertising
*Not leads — impressions and exposure*

| Vendor | Pricing Model | Cost | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------|-------|
| Martindale-Avvo (PPL) | Pay-per-lead | From $5/lead | Bottom-of-directory lead; extremely low intent |
| FindLaw | Monthly subscription | $2,000–$5,000+/month | ~$223/lead documented for one client ($60K → 271 leads, zero signed) |
| Nolo | Monthly subscription | $350–$700/month | $574.95–$699.97/month for Chicago PI market |
| LegalMatch | Monthly subscription | From $455/month | Attorneys respond to self-submitted cases; no cold outreach |

**Attorney ROI reality check:**
- FindLaw documented case (Vaziri Law): $60,372 spent → 271 leads → 0 signed cases
- Nolo: 1.4/5 on Trustpilot. Primary complaint: subscription charges for inconsistent lead volume by geography
- Martindale Sitejabber: 1.3/5. Primary complaint: credits promised but not delivered; leads are people seeking free advice with no budget

**What the pricing reveals:** Subscription pricing divorces vendor revenue from attorney outcomes. The vendor gets paid whether or not a single case is signed. There is no performance alignment.

---

### Tier 1B: Shared Raw Leads
*Sold to multiple competing attorneys simultaneously*

| Vendor | Pricing | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Walker Advertising (entry tier) | From $50/lead | Shared model; attorneys bidding against each other to reach the same claimant |
| Martindale LeadDirect (shared) | ~$50–$150/lead (est.) | Part of the larger Internet Brands ecosystem |
| Undiscovered Profits (benchmark) | $50–$250/lead | Market benchmark for shared PI leads |
| WantMoreCases (entry-level) | $100–$250/case | Territory-exclusive claimed, but low price suggests limited qualification depth |

**The shared lead economics problem:**
- At $50/lead with 5% conversion rate → $1,000 cost-per-signed-case
- At $150/lead with 7% conversion rate → $2,143 cost-per-signed-case
- These look cheap on CPL but are often more expensive than exclusive leads on CPSC
- Contact rate issue: lead fires to 3–5 attorneys simultaneously; by the 3rd call, the claimant stops answering

**TCPA risk overlay:** Post-2025 FCC rules require one-to-one consent — each lead must have express written consent naming the specific firm that will contact them. Shared leads sold without this consent documentation are now legal liability for the purchasing attorney.

---

### Tier 1C: Exclusive Raw Leads
*Sold to one attorney only*

| Vendor | Pricing | Publicly Listed? |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Legal Brand Marketing / MVACase | $3,500/month (10 leads) = $350/lead; $7,000/month (20 leads) = $350/lead | Yes ✓ |
| Injury Leads Hub (MVA) | $300–$1,500/lead (state-dependent) | Yes ✓ |
| Exclusive Leads Agency (auto) | $300–$750/lead | Yes ✓ |
| CounselStack | $175+/lead; $1,500 minimum | Yes ✓ (with wide range caveat) |
| Best Case Leads | ~$250–$500/lead (estimated) | No — estimated from third-party |
| BrokerCalls (inbound calls) | $100–$300/call | Partial (third-party benchmark) |
| DOPPCALL (inbound calls) | $90–$250/call | Partial (third-party benchmark) |
| LeadingResponse | ~$200–$600/lead (estimated) | No |
| Growth Legal | Contact required | No |
| JurisLead | Contact required | No |
| Reda Marketing | Contact required | No |
| Case Growth Experts | Contact required | No |
| Adsurdly | Contact required | No |
| EverConvert | Contact required | No |
| Legal Marketing Leads | Contact required | No |

**The $300–$750 band is the core battleground** for exclusive raw lead providers. This is where Second Chair currently competes at $400/lead.

**Key differentiating variable:** Within this price band, the quality gap between providers is enormous. A $300 lead from a vendor running misleading "million-dollar settlement" ads on Facebook is not the same product as a $400 lead from a vendor running agency-grade behavioral science-informed creative. CPL is the wrong metric; CPSC is the right one, but most attorneys don't yet measure it this way.

### Tier 2A: Live Transfer Leads
*Vendor qualifies caller, warm-transfers live call to attorney*

| Vendor | Pricing | Qualification Depth |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Law Live Transfers | Quote-only; flat rate/transfer | Standard MVA qualifiers confirmed by phone |
| The Legal Leads | Quote-only | 23-question intake form before transfer |
| PI Lawyer Leads | Quote-only | 20+ touch nurturing sequence before transfer |
| On Point Legal Leads | ~$1,500/lead (LinkedIn citation; not officially listed) | Full intake + CRM delivery |
| LeadingResponse "DirectConnect" | ~$200–$600 (estimated) | Standard 4-point filter |
| Ngage Live | Quote-only | Chat → phone transfer; 24/7 |

**Market benchmark for live transfers (Undiscovered Profits data):**
- PI live transfers: $100–$500/transfer
- On Point Legal Leads (calls): $150–$350/call

**The attorney math for live transfers:**
- If a live transfer converts at 25% (conservative for warm call) vs. 10% for cold exclusive form lead
- $500 live transfer × 4 needed for one signed case = $2,000 CPSC
- $400 exclusive form lead × 10 needed for one signed case = $4,000 CPSC
- Live transfers often deliver better CPSC despite 25–50% higher CPL

### Tier 2B: Signed Retainer / Case-Ready Packages
*Vendor handles entire pipeline from ad to signed document*

| Vendor | Pricing | Geography | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Settlement Allies / GetSignedCases** | $2,500 (MN), $3,500 (WA), $6,500 (OR) per signed case | 50 states | **Only provider with fully public per-state pricing** |
| Zero Risk Torts | Quote-only | Nationwide | 1.99M cases originated since 2004; ZeroRisk Compliance Program™ |
| Quintessa Intake | Quote-only | Market-exclusive | "MVA Retainer Engine™"; scarcity model |
| Upper Hand Injury | Quote-only | Nationwide | Consumer brand (upperhandinjury.com) + attorney delivery |
| Mohr Marketing | Quote-only | Nationwide | 30-year veteran; AI behavioral targeting |
| Legal Case Ready | Quote-only; money-back guarantee | MA, FL, NY only | 98% success rate claim |
| On Point Legal Leads (retainer tier) | ~$1,500 (cited in attorney forum) | Nationwide | Mass tort PSC-level clients |

**Why the signed retainer price is defensible:**

The question attorneys ask: "Why would I pay $3,500 for a signed case when I can buy 10 raw leads at $350 each?"

The math answer:
- 10 raw leads at $350 each = $3,500 spent
- 10% conversion (industry average) = 1 signed case
- CPSC: $3,500 — identical to the signed retainer
- But: raw lead path requires attorney's intake team to make 10 attempts to get 1 sign. Signed retainer path: zero intake effort.

If the attorney's intake team costs $30–50/hour and it takes 2–4 hours of intake time per signed case (calls, follow-up, paperwork): $100–$200 in hidden intake cost per case. The signed retainer is actually less expensive on a fully-loaded CPSC basis.

**The psychological barrier:** Raw leads feel like they cost less because the intake labor is invisible. It's already on payroll. Signed retainers feel expensive because the cost is explicit and per-unit.

### Tier 3: Intake Infrastructure Pricing

| Vendor | Pricing | Model |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Smith.ai** | $97.50–$825/month (30–300 calls) | SaaS subscription |
| Alert Communications | Quote-only | Custom retainer |
| Legal Conversion Center | Per-minute or per-lead (no minimums) | Flexible |
| Legal Intaker | $13–$15/hour | Hourly staffing |
| **Filevine / Lead Docket** | $2,000–$4,000 setup + $1,000+/month managed | Enterprise software |
| **Clio Grow** | $59–$149/user/month | SaaS subscription |

**What intake infrastructure tells us:** Even this support layer requires significant monthly investment ($100–$1,000+/month). For a small PI firm buying $3,500/month in raw leads and spending $500/month on Smith.ai for after-hours intake, the real monthly outlay is $4,000+ — before a single case is signed.

## The Pricing Cliff

The single most important structural feature in this pricing map is the **cliff between $750 and $2,500**.

```
$0         $500        $1,000       $1,500       $2,000       $2,500       $5,000
 ├──────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤
              ←────── CROWDED BAND ──────────────────→ ←── CLIFF ──→ ←── SIGNED RETAINER ──
              Raw exclusive + live transfers compete       Few vendors        Signed case delivery
              intensely here ($250–$750)                  here               ($2,500–$6,500)
```

The cliff represents the transition from "lead delivery" to "case delivery." It's where the fundamental product changes — not just the price.

**Strategic implication for Second Chair:** The pricing cliff is also an opportunity cliff. A vendor that can bridge the $750→$2,500 gap with a credible "nurtured lead" or "qualified live transfer" product priced at $1,000–$1,500 occupies almost uncontested territory — above the commodity raw lead battle but below the signed retainer commitment threshold.

## Pricing Opacity: The Data

**The most important pricing fact in this category:**

Of 37 vendors researched:
- **13 (35%)** publish at least some pricing publicly
- **24 (65%)** require sales engagement before any pricing is disclosed

Of the 13 that do publish:
- **4** publish only approximate ranges (without specifying what drives the variance)
- **5** publish genuinely actionable pricing that allows pre-engagement ROI analysis
- **4** publish partial pricing (entry tier only or subscription rate without per-lead cost)

**What opacity costs attorneys:** Without pricing, attorneys cannot calculate expected ROI before engaging the sales process. They enter a negotiation without benchmarks. They're dependent on the vendor's salesperson — who has every incentive to frame pricing favorably — to understand the cost structure of a potential multi-thousand-dollar monthly commitment.

**What opacity costs vendors:** It generates friction, skepticism, and comparison shopping through competitor pitches. Attorneys who can't evaluate cost online default to calling multiple vendors and choosing whoever manages the sales process best — not necessarily the one with the best product.

**The transparency opportunity for Second Chair:** In a market where 65% of vendors hide pricing, being one of the 35% that publishes is itself a positioning move. MVACase proved this — their public pricing page is cited by attorneys as a rare and trust-building differentiator in an otherwise opaque market.

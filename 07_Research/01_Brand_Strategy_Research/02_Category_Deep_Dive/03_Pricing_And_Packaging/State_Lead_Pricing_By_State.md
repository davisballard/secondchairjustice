## Overview

Lead pricing in PI is not uniform across states. The variation is large, structural, and predictable — driven by four primary factors:

1. **No-fault vs. tort insurance system** — which cases can be litigated, and what injury threshold must be cleared
2. **Average MVA case settlement value** — which determines the contingency fee economics and what attorneys can pay per lead
3. **Market competition density** — how many attorneys are competing for the same leads in a given DMA
4. **State bar advertising compliance complexity** — additional compliance costs in high-regulation states raise the vendor's cost of delivery, which flows into price

This document maps all four factors by state and produces Second Chair's recommended pricing framework by state tier.

## Part 1: No-Fault vs. Tort State Map

### The Structural Importance

No-fault states are not simply "harder markets." They are **different markets with different economics:**

- In a **tort state**, any accident victim can hire a PI attorney and sue for all damages including pain and suffering. The volume of potentially litigable cases is high.
- In a **no-fault state**, accident victims must first exhaust their own Personal Injury Protection (PIP) insurance before they can sue. To cross into litigation, injuries must typically exceed a statutory "threshold" (serious injury standard). This eliminates minor injury cases from the litigable pool entirely.

**The lead gen implication:** In no-fault states, the pool of *litigable* cases is smaller (only serious-injury cases qualify), but the *value per case* is significantly higher. Attorneys in no-fault states are buying leads that, if qualified correctly, have higher average settlement values — which justifies higher per-lead prices. The flip side: lead qualification must be tighter (only cases that will clear the threshold are worth pursuing), which raises the cost of delivery.

### No-Fault State List (2025)

**Pure no-fault states (PIP required, lawsuit threshold applies):**

| State | PIP Minimum | Lawsuit Threshold | Lead Price Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **New York** | $50,000/person | Serious injury (fracture, permanent limitation, etc.) | **Highest premium — +30–50%** |
| **Michigan** | $50,000 to unlimited (choice) | Serious impairment of body function | **Highest premium — +30–50%** |
| **Florida** | $10,000/person | Permanent injury / significant scarring | **Moderate premium — +15–25%** |
| **New Jersey** | $15,000/person | Verbal threshold (serious injury) or tort option | **Moderate premium — +15–20%** |
| **Pennsylvania** | $5,000/person | Limited tort (soft tissue excluded unless serious) or full tort option | **Moderate premium — +10–20%** |
| **Massachusetts** | $8,000/person | $2,000 in medical expenses or serious injury | **Moderate premium — +15–20%** |
| **Minnesota** | $40,000/person | Disability >60 days OR medical bills >$4,000 | **Moderate premium — +15–20%** |
| **Hawaii** | $10,000/person | Serious injury definition | **Low-moderate premium — +10–15%** |
| **Kansas** | $4,500/person | Medical bills >$2,000 OR specific serious injuries | **Low-moderate premium — +10–15%** |
| **North Dakota** | $30,000/person | Medical bills >$2,500 OR serious injury | **Moderate premium — +10–15%** |
| **Utah** | $3,000/person | Medical bills >$3,000 OR serious injury | **Low premium — +5–10%** |

**Choice no-fault states (attorneys can opt into full tort or limited tort):**
- **Kentucky** — choice between full and limited tort
- **New Jersey** — as above
- **Pennsylvania** — as above

These three allow the insured to choose their coverage level, creating a mixed-market situation. Attorneys in choice states need leads that have confirmed full-tort opt-in to have the highest litigation value.

### Pure Tort States (No PIP Threshold)

All other states operate on a fault system — any injury from a car accident where another party is at fault is potentially litigable. This creates higher lead volume but lower average case value per lead, as minor soft-tissue cases compete with severe injury cases in the same lead pool.

**Key tort state markets for Second Chair (by revenue opportunity):**

| State | Market Size | CPC Benchmark | Lead Price Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| **California** | Largest U.S. PI market | $971–$977 (truck accident) | $350–$500/lead |
| **Texas** | Second-largest | $585–$1,000 (specialty keywords) | $300–$450/lead |
| **Illinois** (Chicago) | Major metro concentration | $300–$500 range | $300–$400/lead |
| **Georgia** (Atlanta) | Growing market | $250–$400 range | $250–$350/lead |
| **Nevada** (Las Vegas) | Tourism-driven accidents, diverse demo | $200–$350 range | $225–$325/lead |
| **Arizona** | Midsize market, high Spanish-speaking % | $200–$300 range | $200–$300/lead |

## Part 2: Regional CPL Benchmarks (Research-Validated)

Published research from FirstPageSage and LeadGen Economy provides validated regional CPL benchmarks across all lead channels (not just Second Chair's exclusive model, but usable as market pricing context):

| Region | Average CPL (All PI Channels) | Premium vs. Midwest Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| **Northeast** (NY, NJ, MA, CT, ME) | $468 | +49% |
| **West** (CA, WA, OR, NV, AZ) | $402 | +28% |
| **Southeast** (FL, GA, NC, TN) | $389 | +24% |
| **South** (TX, LA, OK, AR) | $382 | +22% |
| **Midwest** (IL, OH, MI, MN, IN) | $314 | Baseline |

**Note:** These are blended averages across all PI channels and all delivery types. Second Chair's exclusive MVA lead pricing operates within the exclusive raw lead band ($300–$850), so these regional benchmarks validate the *relative* pricing differential across markets, not the absolute price.

## Part 3: GetSignedCases Per-State Pricing (The Only Public Benchmark for Signed Cases)

GetSignedCases / Accident Payments is the only competitor publishing specific per-state signed case pricing. Their model is the closest public analog to where Second Chair's pricing is heading at the high end:

| State | GetSignedCases Price Per Signed Case |
|---|---|
| **New York** | $2,500 |
| **Texas** | $3,500 |
| **California** | $6,500 |

**Why California is 2.6x New York:** California has the highest average MVA case settlement values (driven by high medical costs, large urban population, tort-state full damages), the most competitive attorney market, and the highest average contingency fee income per case. The economics support $6,500 per signed case because a fully litigated CA MVA case can produce $50,000–$200,000+ in settlement value and $15,000–$60,000 in attorney fees.

**What this means for Second Chair's raw lead pricing:** Working backwards from the CPSC model:
- If GetSignedCases charges $2,500 per signed case in NY, and an exclusive raw lead converts to a signed case at 10%, the implied raw lead value in NY is $250 — but that ignores the intake labor cost. With intake labor factored in ($100–$200 per signed case), the equivalent exclusive raw lead price that produces the same CPSC is $300–$350 in NY.
- Second Chair's $400 NY lead price is above this implied value — meaning the product needs to convert at 12–15% (not just 10%) to be cost-equivalent to GetSignedCases. This is the target conversion bar.

## Part 4: Second Chair State Pricing Framework

### The Pricing Logic

Second Chair's lead price by state is driven by three variables:
1. **No-fault premium** — markets where only serious injuries are litigable require higher-quality leads, which cost more to acquire and qualify
2. **Average attorney willingness to pay** — proxied by Google Ads CPC for PI keywords (if attorneys are paying $300/click on Google, they will pay $300–$500 for a qualified exclusive lead)
3. **Delivery cost** — media CPM and CPL in the DMA drives Second Chair's cost of goods; price must maintain target margin

### Recommended Pricing by Market (Launch Phase)

**Tier 1: No-Fault Premium Markets**

| Market | Recommended Price | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| New York City Metro | **$450/lead** | No-fault premium + highest CPL region + competitive attorney market |
| Long Island / Upstate NY | **$400/lead** | No-fault premium, lower competition than NYC |
| Northern NJ | **$400/lead** | No-fault + NJ threshold; proximity to NYC market |
| Miami / South Florida | **$375/lead** | FL no-fault, but $10K PIP minimum = more cases cross threshold |
| Boston Metro | **$400/lead** | No-fault premium + high settlement values |
| Detroit Metro | **$425/lead** | Michigan's unlimited PIP option = highest no-fault threshold; serious cases only |

**Tier 2: High-Value Tort Markets**

| Market | Recommended Price | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Los Angeles Metro | **$400/lead** | Highest CA market; attorney CPC of $970+ validates willingness to pay |
| San Francisco / Bay Area | **$375/lead** | High settlement values, concentrated market |
| Houston | **$350/lead** | High-volume market; truck/auto intersection; $585-1000 CPC on specialty terms |
| Dallas / DFW | **$325/lead** | Large market, high competition, slightly lower than Houston |
| Chicago Metro | **$325/lead** | Major market, IL tort state, competitive CPL |
| Atlanta | **$300/lead** | Growing market, lower cost base |

**Tier 3: Mid-Market and Launch Markets**

| Market | Recommended Price | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Las Vegas Metro | **$275/lead** | Diverse demo, moderate market, strong Hispanic segment |
| Phoenix / Scottsdale | **$275/lead** | Large Spanish-speaking population; lower attorney density |
| Orlando / Tampa | **$300/lead** | FL no-fault premium partially offset by competition |
| Denver | **$275/lead** | Growing market, moderate CPL region |

### The Price Justification Framework (for Sales Conversations)

When Sasha is explaining why NY leads cost $450 and Nevada leads cost $275, the script is:

> "Price reflects two things: what it costs us to reach and qualify the right person in that market, and what a qualified case is worth to you. In New York, only serious injuries can be litigated — which means we're finding you clients who clear the threshold before we deliver. That's more work on our end, and the cases you get are worth more on yours. In Nevada, we can bring you more volume at a lower price because the tort state system gives you access to a broader case pool. Same quality standard — different market economics."

## Part 5: State Bar Advertising Compliance Overlay

Some states impose additional restrictions on legal advertising that affect lead gen vendor compliance costs and, indirectly, lead prices:

| State | Key Advertising Restriction | Impact on Lead Pricing |
|---|---|---|
| Florida | Must file ads with Florida Bar; specific disclaimers required | +5% cost premium |
| Texas | State bar approval required for certain ad types; no misleading settlement claims | Moderate compliance overhead |
| New York | Disclaimer requirements; prior approval for some TV/digital ads | Moderate compliance overhead |
| California | Must not guarantee outcomes; specific consumer advertising rules | Low-moderate overhead |
| New Jersey | Advertising rules for PI; referral fee restrictions | Moderate overhead |

**For Second Chair specifically:** Honest consumer advertising (no false settlement claims, no "million-dollar" guarantees) avoids the highest-risk compliance issues in every state. This is a structural advantage — the compliance cost of honest advertising is lower than the compliance cost of misleading advertising, which creates legal exposure on top of operational cost.

## Summary: State Pricing Decision Matrix

| Factor | Makes Price Higher | Makes Price Lower |
|---|---|---|
| Insurance system | No-fault (threshold system) | Pure tort (open litigation) |
| Settlement values | High average settlement (CA, NY) | Lower average settlement (Midwest) |
| Attorney competition | Dense attorney market | Sparse attorney market |
| DMA media cost | High CPM / CPL (urban) | Low CPM / CPL (rural / mid-market) |
| Compliance complexity | High-restriction states | Low-restriction states |

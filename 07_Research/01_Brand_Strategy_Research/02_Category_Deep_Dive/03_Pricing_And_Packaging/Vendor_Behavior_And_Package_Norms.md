## Overview

This document answers three questions critical to Second Chair's go-to-market structure:

1. How many lead gen vendors do PI attorneys run simultaneously — and how do they manage multi-vendor relationships?
2. What are the standard package sizes, minimums, and contract structures in this category?
3. How do free trials and money-back guarantees signal quality (or the absence of it)?

The answers directly inform Second Chair's packaging strategy, minimum commitment framing, and how to position a 100-lead starting point without triggering the "commitment anxiety" that kills trial conversations.

## Part 1: Multi-Vendor Behavior — How Many Vendors Do Attorneys Actually Use?

### The Market Reality: Attorneys Are Portfolio Buyers

PI attorneys do not commit to a single lead generation vendor. The market standard is a **multi-vendor portfolio approach** — attorneys allocate budget across 2–5 vendors simultaneously, treating lead generation the way a sophisticated investor treats a portfolio: test multiple sources, measure CPSC across each, weight toward performers, cut underperformers.

**Why multi-vendor is the norm:**
- No single vendor has achieved category dominance or earned the trust of exclusive commitment
- Attorney risk tolerance for vendor failure is low — spreading across vendors hedges against a dry month from any single source
- Testing new vendors requires no displacement of existing ones; it's an allocation decision, not a switching decision
- Month-to-month contract terms (standard in this category) make adding vendors frictionless

**The shared lead version of multi-vendor:**
In shared lead models, the same lead is simultaneously sold to 3–5 competing firms at the moment of submission. The first firm to call (within 10–60 seconds) typically wins the contact. This creates a "race to the phone" dynamic that erodes contact rates and brand dignity for everyone — and is one of the primary drivers of attorney dissatisfaction with the category.

The exclusive lead model exists precisely to eliminate the shared-lead race — but even exclusive lead buyers typically use 2–4 vendors in parallel.

### The PILMMA Guidance: Fewer, Higher-Quality

The legal marketing community (led by PILMMA, the dominant PI attorney marketing organization) has been explicitly moving attorneys toward **fewer, higher-quality vendor relationships** rather than volume-based multi-vendor approaches. The 2024–2025 messaging emphasizes:

- Exclusive over shared
- CPSC measurement over CPL
- Strategic partnerships over transactional lead purchasing
- Quality threshold for new vendors before adding them to the mix

This creates an opening for Second Chair: a firm that arrives with agency-grade creative, CPSC measurement, and a clear product thesis fits the PILMMA framework better than any existing vendor in the exclusive raw lead space.

### What This Means for Second Chair's Sales Motion

The entry question is **never** "will you switch from your current vendor to us?" It is **always** "will you allocate a test budget alongside what you're already running?"

The benchmark reported in Second Chair's market intelligence: large firms like Jacoby & Meyers will start with 50 leads from essentially anyone semi-legitimate. The barrier is not convincing them to try something new — it's convincing them that Second Chair is worth the minimum budget allocation required to produce meaningful CPSC data.

## Part 2: Package Sizes, Minimums, and Contract Structure

### The Industry Floor: 50 Leads or Pay-As-You-Go

The category's dominant structure is flexible, low-minimum, pay-as-you-go — specifically designed to reduce the commitment threshold and get attorneys in the door:

| Structure | Example Vendors | Minimum |
|---|---|---|
| No minimum, pay-per-lead | Injury Lead Gen, CounselStack | No minimum |
| Monthly flat packages | MVACase/Legal Brand Marketing | 10 leads/month ($3,500) |
| Custom quote, flexible volume | Most exclusive vendors | Contact required |
| 50-lead informal starting benchmark | Market convention | ~$15,000–$25,000 at $300–$500/lead |

**The 50-lead informal benchmark:** While few vendors publish a specific minimum, attorney market conversations (PILMMA forums, legal marketing discussions) reference 50 leads as the practical starting point for generating enough CPSC data to evaluate a new vendor. Below 50 leads, the sample size is too small to measure conversion with confidence. At 50 leads with a 10% sign rate, you get 5 signed cases — barely enough to evaluate ROI.

**The "no minimum" trap:** Several vendors compete explicitly on "no minimums." The pitch is low-risk entry. The reality: vendors offering "no minimums" are often signaling that their pipeline is thin, their targeting is broad, and their leads are low-qualified. As one industry publication noted: *"Some lead gen companies admit their leads aren't strong, which is why they force large minimum orders"* — the corollary is that truly confident vendors are willing to set a meaningful minimum because they believe in their product.

**Contract terms:** Month-to-month is the category standard. Annual contracts are rare. The few vendors requiring annual commitments (primarily subscription-model players like FindLaw and Nolo) receive the lowest attorney satisfaction scores in the market. The month-to-month structure is not a weakness — it is the category norm and a trust signal when positioned correctly ("we succeed when you renew, so we're aligned on your outcomes").

### Second Chair's Packaging Opportunity: The 100-Lead Premium Signal

The current market floor is 50 leads. The current market ceiling for "try us" mentality is also 50 leads. No vendor in the exclusive raw lead tier ($300–$850 range) is positioning a **100-lead starting minimum as a quality signal.**

The hypothesis: a 100-lead minimum, framed correctly, signals that Second Chair:

1. **Produces enough volume to make the trial meaningful.** 100 leads at 10% sign rate = 10 cases — a statistically valid sample for CPSC evaluation. 50 leads at 10% = 5 cases, which is noise.
2. **Is not trying to get their foot in the door with a token order.** The vendors offering 25-lead or no-minimum packages are building the relationship around low commitment. Second Chair is building it around results, which requires enough volume to produce them.
3. **Is confident in CPSC performance.** A vendor who will only sell you 25 leads is a vendor who isn't sure what 100 leads will produce. A vendor who sets 100 as the floor is a vendor who has run the math.

**The packaging pitch structure:**

> "Our minimum is 100 leads. Here's why: at 10% sign rate — which is the industry baseline — 50 leads produces 5 signed cases. That's not enough data to evaluate our CPSC against your other vendors. 100 leads gives you 10 cases, which is. We're not interested in a trial where you can't actually see the performance. We'd rather wait until you're ready to test it properly."

This framing turns the higher minimum into a confidence signal — the opposite of desperation.

## Part 3: Free Trials, Money-Back Guarantees, and Quality Signaling

### The Market Verdict: Guarantees Signal Doubt

The legal marketing community has developed a clear and largely negative view of free-trial and money-back-guarantee positioning. The consensus:

**What guarantees actually communicate:**
- The vendor isn't confident enough in their product to sell it at full price without a safety net
- The vendor's business model depends on getting attorneys into the funnel with low-friction entries and then relying on inertia to retain them
- The guarantee will be difficult or impossible to actually redeem (attorneys report credits promised but not delivered, returns denied on technicalities)

**Specific findings from attorney reviews:**
- Nolo: 1.4/5 Trustpilot. Primary complaint — subscription charges continue despite poor lead quality; credit promises not honored
- Martindale-Avvo: 1.3/5 Sitejabber. Primary complaint — credits promised for unqualified leads not delivered; leads are people seeking free legal advice, not injured clients
- Legal Case Ready (money-back guarantee): The guarantee generates trial sales but creates ongoing disputes about what qualifies for a refund

**The Mohr Marketing analysis** (one of the category's most respected practitioners) is explicit:

> *"Guaranteed personal injury leads mask the inherent unpredictability of lead generation. Market conditions, consumer behavior, and competitive landscapes create variables beyond any company's control. Guarantees often prioritize quantity over quality, leading to influxes of unqualified contacts."*

**What the sophisticated buyer reads:** An attorney who has been in the market for more than one vendor cycle reads a money-back guarantee as a red flag — not a trust signal. The guarantee is the vendor saying "we know you might be disappointed" before the relationship starts.

### Second Chair's Positioning: Confidence Without a Net

Second Chair's answer to the free trial / money-back guarantee convention is **not to offer one** — and to explain exactly why in the pitch:

> "We don't offer a money-back guarantee because our model doesn't need one. We publish our CPSC methodology before you sign anything. We show you the advertising creative we're running before you commit. We give you a reference call with a current client before we write a contract. Our confidence isn't in a refund policy — it's in transparent proof. If the proof doesn't satisfy you, don't sign. If it does, let's get started."

This is a complete inversion of the guarantee pitch. It positions Second Chair as the vendor that sells on evidence, not on risk-reduction theater.

## Key Numbers: Package Structure Quick Reference

| Metric | Market Floor | Market Mid | Market Convention | Second Chair Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Starting minimum (leads) | No minimum | 10–25 leads | 50 leads (informal) | 100 leads |
| Starting minimum (spend) | $0 | $3,500–$7,500 | $15,000–$25,000 | $40,000 |
| Contract length | Monthly | Monthly | Monthly | Monthly |
| Free trial availability | Common | Some | Declining | None |
| Money-back guarantee | Common | Some | Declining | None |
| Trial decision window | 30 days | 30–60 days | 30–60 days | 60–90 days (CPSC) |

**Why the CPSC evaluation window is longer:** Unlike CPL measurement (which tells you something after 2 weeks of lead delivery), CPSC measurement requires the lead to move through intake → consultation → signature. In PI, that process typically takes 2–6 weeks per lead. A 100-lead package delivered over 30 days will produce CPSC data over a 60–90 day window. Second Chair's client conversations need to set this expectation before the first invoice.

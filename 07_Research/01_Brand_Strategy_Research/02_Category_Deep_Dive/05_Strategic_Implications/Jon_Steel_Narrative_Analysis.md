## The Research I'd Ignore First

Before I tell you what I think, let me tell you what I'd set aside from the Category Deep Dive research.

All of the performance data. All of the conversion rates and satisfaction scores and CPL benchmarks. I understand why Julian documented it — it's important context. But if you try to find the narrative strategy for Second Chair in a spreadsheet, you'll end up with messaging that sounds like a spreadsheet. And that's why every vendor in this category sounds identical.

The research I'd start with instead is the verbatim attorney quote buried in one of the player profiles. Let me read it back to you:

*"I've spent $80,000 on these people over three years. I don't trust any of them. I just keep trying because I have to do something."*

That's the entire story of this category in three sentences. Not the satisfaction scores. Not the conversion rates. *That sentence.*

**$80,000. Three years. Don't trust any of them. Keep trying. Have to do something.**

Let me peel the onion on what's actually being said there.

## Peeling the Onion: What the Category's Failure Actually Means

### Layer 1 (the obvious reading): Dissatisfied customers

Yes, the attorney is dissatisfied. We knew that from the 1.3/5 stars.

### Layer 2 (one layer deeper): Loss of agency

"I just keep trying because I have to do something." That's not frustration with a bad vendor. That's a feeling of helplessness. The attorney doesn't believe evaluation will lead to a better outcome. They've evaluated. They've tried. They've been disappointed. They've evaluated again. Same result. They've stopped believing the evaluation process works.

This is learned helplessness. The category has taught them that trying harder doesn't change the outcome.

### Layer 3 (the real insight): A broken promise about what it means to be a professional

Here's what I found watching the research from away from the ball — not looking at what attorneys say about lead vendors, but watching what they don't say, and what that silence reveals.

PI attorneys are professional advocates. Their identity — the way they see themselves, the way they justify their work in a world that calls them ambulance chasers — is built around the idea that they *fight for people who can't fight for themselves.* They took injured, powerless people and gave them a voice in a system designed to make them go away quietly.

When a PI attorney buys leads from a vendor who generates those leads with misleading advertising — "you could be owed millions" — they are, in a very direct sense, starting the relationship with their client through deception. The client arrives believing something the attorney knows is false (the settlement promise). The attorney has to manage down expectations they didn't create.

The lead vendor has made the attorney complicit in something the attorney finds professionally humiliating.

**This is the under-the-nose insight that nobody in the category is saying:**

The attorney's relationship to lead generation is a relationship to a version of themselves they don't want to be. Every bad lead vendor isn't just a bad business decision — it's confirmation of the ambulance chaser identity they've spent their career trying to escape.

## The Deprivation Question I Applied to the Category

Jon Steel's methodology from the "got milk?" campaign: *imagine they go without.* What happens?

I applied this not to the attorney, but to the category itself.

What happens when the entire category of lead gen vendors is removed? When the attorney can't buy leads at all?

**They go back to referrals.** Old clients, chiropractors who refer, body shops that tip them off, emergency room contacts. The relationship-based, pre-digital acquisition model.

*What's true about referrals that isn't true about purchased leads?*

With a referral, the claimant arrives having been vouched for by someone who knows both the attorney and the claimant. There's trust in both directions. The claimant trusts the attorney because their chiropractor told them to call. The attorney trusts the claimant because their chiropractor wouldn't send someone who wasn't real.

More than that: with a referral, the attorney feels *good* about how they got the client. There's no shame in it. No sense that they've chased an ambulance. Someone who matters to them said "go see this person — they're good."

**The deprivation test reveals the emotional core of what attorneys have lost by migrating to lead gen:**

*They've lost the good feeling about how they get clients.*

Referrals felt honest. Referrals felt earned. Referrals felt consistent with being the kind of lawyer they wanted to be.

Lead vendors took that away. They replaced it with a process that feels transactional, undignified, and — when the advertising is misleading — morally compromised.

## The Counter-Narrative Second Chair Needs to Own

I've been doing this long enough to know that the best strategic insights are usually so simple that everyone dismisses them.

Here's the simple one:

**The attorney doesn't want better leads. They want to feel good about where their leads come from.**

This is not a rational claim. It's an emotional one. And it's the one no vendor in the category is making.

Every competitor talks about the lead product: exclusive, qualified, high-converting, TCPA-compliant. What they never talk about is how the attorney *feels* about having that lead source. Because the category has normalized the idea that feeling bad about your lead source is just the cost of doing business.

Second Chair's Creative Advantage story is — if you tell it right — not a rational claim about advertising quality. It's an emotional claim about what it feels like to have a lead source you're not ashamed of.

**The narrative I'd give Second Chair:**

*"What if the way you got your clients was something you were actually proud of?"*

Not "we have better leads." Not "our conversion rate is higher." Not "we're TCPA compliant." Those are conversations that start at the bottom of a hole that every vendor has dug the category into.

Start with the thing nobody else has the credibility to say: the advertising Second Chair runs to find accident victims is advertising that's honest about what legal help actually does. No false settlement promises. No "you could be owed millions." Just: "After an accident, you have rights. A free conversation can help you understand them." 

The claimant who arrives from that advertising arrives with accurate expectations. The attorney who takes that call starts from a place of dignity — both theirs and the claimant's.

That's the story. It's simple. It's embarrassingly obvious once you see it. And it's the one story that's available only to Second Chair, because it requires having agency-grade creative as the upstream input — something no other vendor in this category has.

## The Brief I'd Write

If I were to give this to a creative team right now, the brief would look something like this.

**Why are we advertising?**
Because this category has broken attorney trust so completely that the standard "we're different" message doesn't land. We need to restore belief — not in lead gen vendors, but in the idea that there's a better way to grow a practice.

**What should advertising achieve?**
Change how attorneys *feel* about their lead source. Not change what they *think* about it. The emotional shift precedes the rational evaluation.

**Who are we talking to?**
The PI attorney who has been burned. Who has spent money they didn't get back. Who feels some level of professional discomfort about the gap between how they want to build their practice and how they actually do it. They've stopped believing things can be better — and they haven't stopped hoping.

**What do we know about them?**
They got into PI law to fight for people. They're proud of what they do in the courtroom and in settlement negotiations. They're not proud of how they fill their pipeline. Those two things are in tension. That tension is the insight.

**The main thing to communicate:**
Second Chair leads come from advertising you'd put your name on.

*That's it. One thing.*

Not "high quality" (everyone says that). Not "exclusive" (everyone says that). Not "compliant" (everyone says that). The one thing nobody else can credibly say: the advertising is good enough that the attorney wouldn't be embarrassed to show it to their clients.

**Leave room for the mouse:**
Don't explain why the advertising is good. Don't list the reasons. Show the advertising. Let attorneys see it and draw their own conclusion. The evidence IS the argument. The work speaks for itself.

## What I'd Watch For (Away from the Ball)

In testing any creative work against attorney audiences, I'd watch for:

**The lean forward moment.** When do they stop being an audience and start being in the room? For attorneys, that moment is often when they hear their specific fears named without judgment. "I've spent $80,000 on this." The moment of recognition — that's the moment the advertising is working.

**The uncomfortable silence.** What are they not saying? Attorneys won't admit the professional shame dimension of lead gen purchasing in a research setting. Too risky. Too vulnerable. But it's there — in the pause before they answer "why do you keep using vendors that disappoint you?" The pause is longer than it should be if the answer were simply "because there's no alternative."

**The body language.** When they see the advertising Second Chair runs — actual creative, not a description of it — what happens? If they lean back and nod with mild approval, it's not working. If they say "hm, I'd actually be okay showing this to a client" — that's the moment. That's the one I'm looking for.

## The Story That's Available

Most agencies walk into a category and try to create a story that doesn't exist yet. The good ones find the story that's already there, waiting for someone to tell it.

The story that's waiting in this category:

*There was a time when how you grew your practice felt good. Lead vendors took that from you. One of them is trying to give it back.*

That's not complicated. It doesn't require a manifesto or a platform or a purpose statement. It requires one honest thing: advertising that proves it. Show the ads. Let the attorney see that the person who called them came from something decent.

The proof is the story. Second Chair just has to show it.

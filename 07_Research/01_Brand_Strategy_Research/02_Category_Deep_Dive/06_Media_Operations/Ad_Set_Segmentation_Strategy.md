## Overview

This document answers: how should Second Chair segment and structure its Facebook/Meta ad sets when running B2C consumer advertising to generate MVA leads?

The central strategic premise: **the entire PI lead gen category targets a generic majority audience** — primarily white, English-speaking, suburban. The data shows that Hispanic, Black, and other underserved communities are disproportionately represented in traffic accident statistics relative to how PI advertising reaches them. This is both an ethical gap (these communities deserve the same access to legal representation) and a competitive gap (less saturation = lower CPM, higher response rates, less competition from other PI vendors for the same lead).

Second Chair's honest advertising — not promising million-dollar settlements, not using manipulative tactics, using real language and real representation — is specifically suited to audiences who have been mis-sold by other vendors and are appropriately skeptical. This document maps the segmentation architecture for launch and scale.

## Part 1: The Demographic Data — Why Underserved Communities Are the Strategic Priority

### Traffic Accident Rates vs. PI Advertising Reach

The gap is structural and validated by federal data (NHTSA 2020, CDC 2021):

| Population Group | % of U.S. Population | % of Traffic Fatalities | % of PI Legal Advertising (est.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| White (non-Hispanic) | ~60% | 41% | ~75–80% (dominant in advertising) |
| Hispanic / Latino | ~19% | 17% overall, **21% of pedestrian fatalities** | ~5–10% (severely underserved) |
| Black / African American | ~13% | 20% | ~10–15% (underserved) |
| Other | ~8% | ~22% combined | Minimal |

**The Hispanic gap is the most actionable:** 19% of the population, 17–21% of accident victims, but served by less than 6% of PI attorneys (Hispanic lawyers are dramatically underrepresented in the PI bar). The Spanish-speaking PI legal market is described by legal marketing practitioners as offering **"smaller ad spend with greater results than the saturated English-speaking market"** — because the CPM is lower, the competition is lower, and the audience is genuinely underserved.

**The practical translation for Second Chair:** Running Spanish-language ad sets targeting accident-relevant demographics in markets with high Hispanic populations (NYC, Miami, LA, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Houston) will produce:
- Lower CPM than English-language targeting in the same DMA
- Lower competition from other PI lead gen vendors
- Higher qualified lead rates because the audience is actively seeking help with fewer vendor alternatives

This is the "Maria market" — the working parent who does not see herself in the white-lawyer-stock-photo PI ads that saturate the English-speaking digital environment, and who responds to advertising that sees her.

## Part 2: Ad Set Architecture — The Launch Structure

### The Three Segmentation Axes

Second Chair's ad set structure should be organized across three axes simultaneously:

**Axis 1: Language / Cultural Segment**
- English-language general market
- Spanish-language / Hispanic market (Spanglish and full Spanish)
- *(Future: Haitian Creole for South Florida; Mandarin/Cantonese for urban West Coast markets)*

**Axis 2: Geographic DMA**
- Each major market gets its own campaign with its own budget
- Prevents cross-market budget contamination
- Allows DMA-specific creative (local landmarks, local attorneys' market context, local media buy timing)

**Axis 3: Behavioral / Timing Signal**
- Recent accident behavioral signals (not directly targetable on Meta due to special ad category restrictions, but proxied through interest targeting)
- Retargeting (people who have visited accident-related content, legal aid resources, hospital finder pages)
- Lookalike audiences built from past converted leads

### The Launch Ad Set Map (NY + FL Year 1)

**Market: New York City Metro**

| Ad Set | Language | Audience | Budget Allocation |
|---|---|---|---|
| NYC-EN-General | English | Metro area, 25–65, general accident-relevant behaviors | 40% of NYC budget |
| NYC-ES-Hispanic | Spanish/Spanglish | Metro area, 18–60, Spanish-language preference, Hispanic community | 35% of NYC budget |
| NYC-EN-Retarget | English | Website visitors, video viewers, lead form openers (last 30 days) | 15% of NYC budget |
| NYC-EN-Lookalike | English | 1–2% lookalike of past converted leads | 10% of NYC budget |

**Market: Miami / South Florida**

| Ad Set | Language | Audience | Budget Allocation |
|---|---|---|---|
| MIA-EN-General | English | South Florida metro, general | 30% of MIA budget |
| MIA-ES-Hispanic | Spanish/Spanglish | Spanish-speaking South Florida (Cuban, Venezuelan, Colombian, Puerto Rican communities) | 45% of MIA budget |
| MIA-EN-Retarget | English | Retargeting pool | 15% of MIA budget |
| MIA-EN-Lookalike | English | Lookalike from past leads | 10% of MIA budget |

*Note: Miami's Hispanic ad set allocation is higher (45%) than NYC's (35%) because Miami's Hispanic population is ~70% of the metropolitan area, versus ~30% in NYC. The budget weight follows the market.*

**How to expand to new markets:** When Second Chair launches a new DMA, the baseline template is always: 40% English general, 30–45% Spanish (weighted by DMA Hispanic population %), 15% retargeting, 10% lookalike. Adjust the Spanish weight up or down based on census data for that DMA.

## Part 3: Meta Targeting — What PI Lead Gen Can Actually Do

### The Critical Clarification: PI Legal Is NOT a Special Ad Category

A previous draft of this document suggested PI lead gen might fall under Meta's Special Ad Categories with restricted targeting. **This is incorrect and has been corrected.**

Meta's Special Ad Categories apply exclusively to:
- **Housing** (home sales, rentals, mortgages, homeowner's insurance)
- **Employment** (job listings, internships, certification programs)
- **Financial Products and Services** (banking, investment, payment services, credit)
- **Social Issues, Elections, and Politics**

**Personal injury legal advertising does not qualify for any of these categories.** Second Chair is not offering housing, a job, a financial product, or a political position. It is advertising access to legal representation for accident victims. Standard Meta advertising rules apply in full.

### What This Means: Full Standard Targeting Is Available

Because PI legal falls outside Special Ad Categories, Second Chair has access to the complete Meta targeting toolkit:

| Targeting Option | Available? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language targeting (Spanish) | **Yes — full** | Target users whose Facebook language is Spanish or who engage primarily with Spanish content |
| Zip code geography | **Yes — full** | No state-level-only restriction; can target specific zip codes in priority DMAs |
| Detailed interest targeting | **Yes — full** | Accident recovery, insurance content, legal aid, medical content |
| Demographic layering (age, gender) | **Yes — full** | Standard demographic targeting available |
| Lookalike audiences | **Yes — full** | Build from past qualified lead lists without restriction |
| Custom audiences | **Yes — full** | Upload past lead data, pixel-based audiences, video viewers |
| Behavioral signals | **Yes — full** | Life events, purchase behavior, content engagement |
| Exclusion targeting | **Yes — with caution** | Do not exclude by race, national origin, or religion (civil rights policy applies regardless of Special Ad Category) |

**The only restriction that applies regardless of category:** Do not use exclusion targeting based on protected characteristics (race, national origin, religion, gender). This is Meta's baseline civil rights policy for all advertisers. Inclusion-based targeting (targeting Spanish speakers) is fully permissible; exclusion-based targeting (excluding non-Spanish speakers by demographic) is not. In practice, language targeting achieves the same result without the civil rights issue — you target Spanish-preference users, not exclude non-Spanish users.

### Language Targeting: How It Actually Works

Meta's language targeting identifies users in one of two ways:

1. **Language preference setting** — the language a user has set in their Facebook/Instagram profile settings
2. **Content engagement signal** — the language of content a user predominantly engages with, even if they haven't explicitly set a language preference

Setting a campaign's language to "Spanish (All)" will reach users who are Spanish-dominant by either signal. It does not guarantee zero English-speaker crossover (a bilingual user might engage in both languages), but the targeting is accurate enough that Spanish-language campaigns primarily reach Spanish-dominant audiences without wasting significant budget on non-Spanish speakers.

**The efficiency advantage:** Spanish-language targeting in PI markets produces lower CPMs than English-language targeting in the same DMA — because fewer advertisers are competing for that audience. Less competition = lower cost per impression = more leads for the same budget.

### No "Accident Targeting" Signal — Proxying Is Required

Meta does not offer "recently in a car accident" as a targetable interest. Reaching accident victims requires proxying through adjacent signals:
- Interest in personal injury attorney content, insurance companies, hospital/emergency care content
- Behavioral signals: recent life events, financial stress signals
- Retargeting: users who have visited accident-related web content, legal aid pages, "what to do after a car accident" articles
- Lookalike audiences built from past converted leads (most effective once data exists)

**Post-iOS 14 context:** Behavioral targeting precision declined after Apple's App Tracking Transparency changes in 2021. Broad audience targeting with strong, relevant creative now outperforms narrow interest stacks in many markets. This favors Second Chair — creative quality is the differentiator, and Second Chair has it.

### What to Run as Special Ad Category (for the record)

If Second Chair ever runs ads that could be construed as offering **financial products** (e.g., lawsuit funding, settlement advance advertising), those would require the Financial Products and Services designation. Standard PI legal advertising — "were you in an accident? know your rights before you settle" — does not.

## Part 4: Creative Requirements by Ad Set

### The English-Language General Market Set

**Creative brief for this segment:**
- Visual: Real people, not stock lawyer photography. Real accident aftermath or recovery imagery that does not sensationalize. Testimonial-style framing.
- Tone: Direct, empathetic, clear. "If you were in an accident and the insurance company has already contacted you — read this before you respond."
- CTA: "Know your rights before you settle" or "Get a free case review before the insurance company closes your claim"
- Format: Single image (awareness) + video (trust-building) + Lead Ad form (conversion)

**What competitors do that Second Chair does not:**
- "You may be owed MILLIONS" — eliminated entirely
- Stock photo of smiling attorney in front of scales of justice — eliminated
- Settlement outcome boasts — eliminated
- High-pressure "Act now before your claim expires" false urgency — eliminated

### The Spanish-Language / Hispanic Market Set

**Creative brief for this segment:**
- Language: Spanish-first, Spanglish acceptable for acculturated audiences. Full Spanish for first-generation and recent immigrants.
- Visual: Latino families, faces that reflect the community being reached. Not "diversity stock photography" — authentic representation.
- Tone: Warm, peer-to-peer. The tone of a trusted community member, not a corporate advertising voice. Avoid legal jargon in any language.
- Key messaging hook: *"La compañía de seguros ya te llamó. No firmes nada todavía."* (The insurance company already called you. Don't sign anything yet.)
- Secondary hook: "¿Hablas con alguien que te entiende?" (Are you talking to someone who understands you?) — validates that Second Chair connects Spanish-speaking clients to firms with Spanish-speaking intake
- CTA: Lead form in Spanish. Intake confirmation in Spanish.

**The intake alignment requirement:** Spanish-language ads only work if the intake process also accommodates Spanish speakers. Before running Spanish-language ad sets in any market, Second Chair must confirm that the attorney receiving these leads has Spanish-speaking intake staff. This is a delivery quality requirement, not just a media requirement.

**Why this segment outperforms:** The Abogados Now research (the dominant Hispanic PI legal marketing firm) is explicit: *"The Spanish-speaking PI market offers smaller ad spends with greater results than the saturated English-speaking market."* Less competition + more authentic creative + higher relevance = lower CPL and higher qualification rate.

## Part 5: Ad Set Testing Logic

### The Testing Protocol

Every new market launch follows this sequence:

**Phase 1 (Week 1–2): Traffic Test**
- Run all ad sets at low budget ($50–$100/day per set)
- Measure: CPM, CTR, cost per landing page view
- Kill: Any set with CPM > 2x the market average after 7 days of data
- Learn: Which creative executions drive CTR; which audiences engage

**Phase 2 (Week 3–4): Conversion Test**
- Scale winning ad sets from Phase 1 (2x budget)
- Measure: CPL, form fill rate, lead quality (qualification rate)
- Kill: Any set with CPL > $400 (the pricing threshold where margin disappears)
- Learn: Which audiences convert to qualified leads, not just form fills

**Phase 3 (Day 30+): Optimization**
- Shift budget toward lowest CPSC sets (not lowest CPL — downstream conversion matters)
- Begin lookalike audience builds from qualified leads database
- Test creative variants on proven audiences

### The Kill Criteria

| Metric | Kill Threshold | Why |
|---|---|---|
| CPM | > $75 sustained | Media costs exceeding target; DMA too competitive |
| CTR | < 0.5% after 1,000 impressions | Creative not resonating; needs refresh |
| CPL (raw form fill) | > $400 | Approaching the price ceiling; no margin |
| Qualification rate | < 35% | Targeting too broad; reaching wrong audience |
| Lead-to-contact rate | < 50% (attorney contacts lead within 24h) | Attorney intake issue, not media issue — flag to account team |

## Part 6: Multi-Market Simultaneous Launch

### Running NY + FL (or Any Two Markets) Without Cross-Contamination

**The structural issue:** Running campaigns in multiple markets simultaneously on Meta can produce audience overlap — a Miami user who travels to NYC might see both market-specific ads. This is minor at scale but wastes budget on dual-market impression costs.

**The solution:** Strict geographic targeting with a 15–20 mile DMA boundary exclusion between markets. Meta's geographic targeting allows city-level specificity. Each market campaign explicitly excludes the geographic radius of any other active market campaign.

**The budget independence principle:** Each market gets its own campaign (not just ad sets) in Meta's structure. This ensures:
- Budget does not bleed from one market to another
- Results are trackable by market in isolation
- Underperforming markets can be paused without affecting active markets
- Attribution is clean for reporting to attorneys in each market

**What Alex needs to build to support this structure:** A campaign performance dashboard that pulls Meta API data by campaign (market) and ad set (segment), matches to lead qualification outcomes, and calculates CPSC by market and audience segment. This is the data infrastructure that makes Second Chair's media buying genuinely better than competitors who optimize on CPL alone.

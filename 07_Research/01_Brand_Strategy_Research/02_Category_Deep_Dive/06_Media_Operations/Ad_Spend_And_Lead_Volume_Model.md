## Overview

This document answers a specific operational question: if Second Chair sells 100-lead packages at $400/lead ($40,000 revenue), what media spend is required to produce those 100 leads — and what does that imply for margin, daily budget, and business model viability?

It also answers the production question: given realistic media costs, how many leads per day should Second Chair expect to deliver, and how should client expectations be set accordingly?

The model uses three scenarios (conservative, realistic, agency-optimized) because the honest answer to "how much does it cost to produce a lead?" is: **it depends heavily on creative quality, targeting precision, and landing page conversion rate.** Second Chair's creative advantage means it should be operating in the agency-optimized scenario over time — but launch performance will be closer to the realistic scenario.

## Part 1: The Core Funnel Math

### The PI Lead Generation Funnel

```
AD IMPRESSION
     ↓
  CLICK (CTR: 1–3%)
     ↓
 LANDING PAGE / LEAD FORM (Conversion: 8–15% optimized, 3–4% generic homepage)
     ↓
  RAW LEAD (form fill or call)
     ↓
 QUALIFICATION FILTER (confirms: MVA, within statute, no attorney, no prior claim)
     ↓
  EXCLUSIVE QUALIFIED LEAD (delivered to attorney)
     ↓
 ATTORNEY INTAKE (speed-to-lead: <60 seconds = optimal)
     ↓
  SIGNED CASE (conversion rate: 10–20% qualified lead → signed)
```

**The two key levers Second Chair controls:**
1. **CPL at the media layer** — driven by creative quality, targeting precision, and landing page conversion
2. **Lead qualification rate** — what percentage of raw form fills survive the qualification filter to become deliverable leads

Both levers are where Second Chair's creative and product capabilities create structural advantage over generic lead gen operators.

## Part 2: Media Cost Benchmarks (2025 Validated Data)

### Facebook / Meta

| Metric | Low | Mid | High | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions)** | $14.26 (Jan 2026 low) | $49.70 (2025 avg) | $62.91 (Oct 2025) | SuperAds.ai / Legal vertical |
| **CTR** | 0.5% | 1.2% | 2.5% | Industry benchmark |
| **Landing page conversion** | 3–4% (generic) | 8–12% (optimized) | 13–18% (lead ad native form) | LegalLeadsDigital, BestPPC |
| **Blended CPL (legal, all PI)** | $67 (Jan 2026 low) | $164–$286 | $512 (medical malpractice) | FirstPageSage 2026 |
| **Auto accident CPL specifically** | $200 | $286 | $400+ | FirstPageSage |

**Why the January 2026 CPM of $14.26 matters:** Media costs on Meta drop sharply in January (post-holiday advertiser pullback). This creates a launch timing opportunity — launching media in January or February captures the lowest CPMs of the year, producing more leads for the same budget before competition normalizes costs through Q2.

### Google Ads

| Metric | Low | Mid | High | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CPC (PI attorney-facing keywords)** | $125 | $200–$350 | $1,000 (specialty/market) | iLawyerMarketing, BestPPC |
| **CPL via Google (PI, auto accident)** | $300 | $391 | $600+ | FirstPageSage regional data |

**Google vs. Meta for Second Chair's B2C targeting:**

Second Chair is running **consumer-facing ads** to accident victims, not attorney-facing ads. This is a critical distinction:
- Attorney-facing Google Ads (attorneys searching for "PI marketing agency") command the $125–$1,000 CPC range shown above
- Consumer-facing Google Ads (accident victims searching "car accident lawyer near me") are significantly cheaper — typical CPC $5–$30 for consumer queries
- Consumer-facing Facebook/Meta targeting uses behavioral and demographic targeting, not keyword intent — CPMs are lower but require stronger creative to drive conversion

For Second Chair's B2C media: **Facebook is the primary channel** (behavioral targeting, lower CPM, creative-driven performance). Google Search can be used for retargeting and high-intent consumer queries at much lower CPCs than attorney-facing terms.

## Part 3: The 100-Lead Production Model

### Model Inputs

| Variable | Conservative | Realistic | Agency-Optimized |
|---|---|---|---|
| Facebook CPM | $49.70 | $40.00 | $28.00 |
| Landing page conversion rate | 4% | 10% | 15% |
| Qualification rate (form fills → deliverable leads) | 40% | 55% | 70% |
| Effective CPL (delivered, qualified) | $450–$600 | $200–$300 | $100–$175 |

**Why qualification rate matters so much:** At a 40% qualification rate, you need 250 raw form fills to produce 100 deliverable leads. At 70%, you need only 143 form fills. The difference comes entirely from: (a) creative honesty (not using misleading hooks that attract unqualifiable leads) and (b) targeting precision (reaching people who are actually likely to be accident victims, not curiosity clickers).

Second Chair's honest advertising model is directly advantageous here: if the ad does not promise a million-dollar settlement, it will not attract people who are not actually injured. Honest creative produces a higher qualification rate almost by definition.

### The 100-Lead Budget Scenarios

**Scenario A: Conservative (Generic creative, broad targeting, lower conversion)**
- Target: 100 qualified leads in 30 days
- Effective CPL: ~$500
- Required media spend: **~$50,000/month**
- Revenue at $400/lead: $40,000
- **Margin: Negative. This scenario loses money.**
- Reality check: This is what a generic digital marketing agency produces with off-the-shelf creative. It is why agency-grade creative is not a "nice to have" — it is the margin.

**Scenario B: Realistic (Competent creative, decent targeting, standard conversion)**
- Target: 100 qualified leads in 30 days
- Effective CPL: ~$250
- Required media spend: **~$25,000/month**
- Revenue at $400/lead: $40,000
- **Gross margin: $15,000 (37.5%)**
- Daily spend: ~$833/day | Daily leads: ~3.3/day
- This is a viable business. It matches published benchmarks for competent PI lead gen operators.

**Scenario C: Agency-Optimized (Second Chair's creative advantage, precision targeting)**
- Target: 100 qualified leads in 30 days
- Effective CPL: ~$150
- Required media spend: **~$15,000/month**
- Revenue at $400/lead: $40,000
- **Gross margin: $25,000 (62.5%)**
- Daily spend: ~$500/day | Daily leads: ~3.3/day
- This is the target operating model. It's achievable because honest, agency-grade creative produces higher click-through, higher form completion, and higher qualification rates than the category average.

### The Creative Advantage in Numbers

The difference between Scenario A and Scenario C is entirely creative quality and targeting precision:

| What Creates the Difference | Scenario A | Scenario C |
|---|---|---|
| Ad CTR | 0.8% | 2.0% |
| Landing page conversion | 4% | 14% |
| Qualification rate | 40% | 70% |
| **Effective CPL result** | **~$500** | **~$150** |
| **Margin on 100 leads at $400** | **-$10,000** | **+$25,000** |

**This is the core business argument for Second Chair's advertising-led model.** The creative is not a marketing cost — it is the primary driver of margin. A generic lead gen operator cannot compete at $150 CPL. Second Chair can, because agency-grade creative performs 2–3x better at every funnel stage.

## Part 4: Daily Lead Volume and Client Expectation Setting

### The 30-Day / 3-per-Day Reality

At the realistic CPL and a 100-lead package:
- **~3.3 leads per day** average delivery
- This creates a meaningful client management question: how do you set expectations for daily delivery cadence?

The honest answer: **lead delivery is not perfectly linear.** Media performance fluctuates with day of week (Tuesday–Thursday perform best; weekend CPMs are lower but CTR drops), seasonality, and creative fatigue cycles. A 100-lead package over 30 days will produce:
- Some days with 5–7 leads (high-performance days)
- Some days with 1–2 leads (low-performance days)
- Average of 3–4 leads when the campaign is healthy

**Client expectation script:**
> "You'll average 3–4 leads per day on your 100-lead package. Some days will be higher, some lower — media doesn't run perfectly flat. What we guarantee is the total monthly volume, not the daily count. You'll see the data in the dashboard in real time, and if volume falls below pace by week 2, we'll flag it and adjust."

### Scaling Beyond 100 Leads

The 100-lead minimum is a proof-of-concept volume. Once CPSC is validated, attorneys want to scale. How does the model scale?

| Monthly Package | Media Spend (Realistic) | Revenue (@$400) | Gross Margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| 50 leads | $12,500 | $20,000 | $7,500 (37.5%) |
| 100 leads | $25,000 | $40,000 | $15,000 (37.5%) |
| 200 leads | $48,000 | $80,000 | $32,000 (40%) |
| 500 leads | $112,500 | $200,000 | $87,500 (43.75%) |

**Scale creates margin expansion** because fixed overhead (creative, campaign setup, compliance infrastructure) does not scale linearly with lead volume. Creative developed for 100 leads also runs for 200 leads. The media spend scales, but the investment in creative and setup is amortized across more leads.

## Part 5: The Business Model Check

### Can Second Chair Charge $400/Lead and Survive?

At Scenario B (realistic):
- 100 leads → $40,000 revenue
- Media spend: $25,000
- Gross margin: $15,000 (37.5%)
- From $15,000: Alex's infra, Sasha's commission, Davis's time, overhead

**This works at scale.** With 10 clients buying 100 leads/month = $400,000 revenue, $150,000 gross margin before fixed costs. At $150 CPL (agency-optimized), 10 clients = $400,000 revenue, $250,000 gross margin.

### The Premium Lead Tier Opportunity

The pricing architecture research identified a gap between $750 and $2,500 — "nurtured leads" and live transfers occupy this space but almost no vendor executes it well. If Second Chair develops a nurtured lead product (raw lead → 3–5 follow-up touchpoints → warm handoff), the CPL math changes:

| Product | Price | Media + Ops Cost | Gross Margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Exclusive raw lead | $400 | $150–$250 | $150–$250 (37–62%) |
| Nurtured lead (3-touch) | $800–$1,200 | $250–$400 | $400–$800 (50–67%) |
| Live transfer | $1,200–$1,500 | $400–$600 | $600–$1,100 (50–73%) |

**The margin improves as the product moves up the stack** because the conversion rate improvement at the attorney's end reduces attorney churn — making the client relationship stickier and reducing the sales overhead of constant replacement.

## How to Read This Document

The consumer and category research established what attorneys experience with lead gen vendors at a structural level. This document goes to the source: verbatim quotes from attorneys on LinkedIn, in podcasts, on review platforms, and in legal marketing forums. These are not survey responses or focus group simulations — they are on-the-record statements from named attorneys with their firms and LinkedIn profiles attached.

The document is organized by:
1. **What they're saying on LinkedIn** (highest-volume, highest-engagement, most specific)
2. **What they're saying on review platforms** (Trustpilot, SiteJabber — aggregate sentiment)
3. **What legal marketing podcasters say** (practitioners who've operated in the industry)
4. **What they say about the advertising itself** (the insight category most relevant to Second Chair)
5. **What they wish existed** (explicit market demand signals)

## Part 1: LinkedIn — Named Attorneys on the Record

### DARL CHAMPION — The Champion Firm, P.C. (Georgia PI attorney)

**The most documented attorney voice on lead gen advertising ethics.** Multiple public posts with documented evidence, linked to his firm's blog.

**Post 1 — Verbatim LinkedIn post text (full):**
> *"The personal injury marketing world is becoming a cesspool and lead generation companies are largely responsible for polluting it. We're seeing more and more misleading, outlandish videos targeting injury victims. This latest one? It might take the cake. Here's the truth:*
>
> *🚫 It's not an AI database.*
> *🚫 It doesn't tell you exactly how much your claim is worth.*
> *🚫 The people in the videos? Actors, not real clients.*
> *🚫 There's no law requiring insurers to disclose what they pay on each claim that has provided data for this supposed AI app.*
> *🚫 It's not free. They're selling your info to a lawyer who pays them for leads and then charges you a percentage when you hire them (just like every other lawyer).*
> *🚫 You're not getting a 'payout' in weeks.*
> *🚫 There is no 'AI data' they share with the lawyers who use them.*
> *🚫 And no, insurance companies aren't scrambling to shut it down.*
>
> *These lead gen companies prey on confusion and pain. They don't care about people. They only care about money. These modern snakeoil salesmen aren't just harming the public. They're harming lawyers, too, by creating a false narrative about how the process really works. If you're a lawyer, don't use services with ad copy that is filled with lies. Rejecting these services isn't just the right thing to do, but ask yourself: what quality of client and case are you getting with someone who was duped into hiring you? And do you really want to start off the attorney-client relationship that way?"*

**Champion, from his firm's blog (georgiatortlaw.com/blog):**
> *"Under the Rules of Professional Conduct, a lawyer cannot pay a referral service if the service engages in conduct that would violate the Rules if a lawyer engaged in that conduct... Before using any lead generation services, verify what they are doing to generate those so-called leads."*

**Champion on the "Compensation Program" pattern:**
> *"Even their own 'disclaimer' buried in the 'terms and conditions' says the 'new 2024 compensation program' is not a reflection of real events or programs and that users should not rely on such statements. These services use misleading ads like this all the time. And they'll keep doing it as long as lawyers keep paying them for leads."*

### RYAN McKEEN — PI Attorney, Connecticut (24,411 LinkedIn followers)

**Post — verbatim (mid-2024, 60 comments):**
> *"Lawyers should understand that lead generation companies in the personal injury space are continuing to push the envelope... The ads that I see are getting more and more aggressive. This is just one of many examples which seems to promise Huge Compensation for those in a car accident in just 30 days. It raises several things to think about:*
>
> *🤷♂️ What lawyer wants a client with those expectations?*
> *🤷♂️ What are the ethical considerations for attorneys engaging agencies who run these ads?*
> *🤷♂️ Are marketing companies giving potential claimants advice on the potential value of the claims by offering 'free estimates'.*
>
> *I don't expect any of these things to go away. I actually think they will become more ubiquitous. How any of this plays out is anyone's guess. But if I were buying personal injury leads right now - I would be very careful in who I was using and I would demand to know exactly what they are doing on my behalf."*

**McKeen's reality check follow-up (in the same thread):**
> *"For those playing along at home and who aren't in the PI space: Most car accident claims do NOT result in HUGE compensation. If there is HUGE compensation it is almost never in 30 days. It is impossible to guess the value of a case from a web form. Lawyers hire companies to generate leads. These companies then run ads and serve those leads to lawyers."*

**Brian Glass, PI attorney (Fairfax, VA), commenting on McKeen's post:**
> *"If this is who I think it is they're showing lawyers ads promising to deliver leads… and showing leads ads promising to deliver a big settlement WITHOUT legal fees. Based on the number of ads they're running, someone must be paying them…"*

**Allen Tittle** (same thread):
> *"These ads really are insane."*

**Bill Hauser** (same thread):
> *"Yeah, these PI lead gen companies are insane."*

**Chris Finney, Attorney** (same thread):
> *"This type of stuff happens way too often."*

**Loren Schwartz, Attorney** (same thread):
> *"I am increasingly seeing practicing lawyers stooping to similarly low levels, spewing similar BS, talking about finding out 'instantly what your case is worth' with dollar bills coming down from the sky and with promises to 'GET YOU PAID!' I am out of adjectives to describe this race-to-the-bottom advertising."*

**Kimberly DeCarrera** (same thread):
> *"Lawyers need to understand that they are responsible for what their marketing companies are putting out there on their behalf. It's the lawyers license at risk, not the marketing company's license. Stay on top of the tactics, the messages, and demand the results."*

**Frank Rekas** (same thread):
> *"Under promise and over deliver. It's old and boring, but true. Setting high expectations, normally results in big disappointments."*

### MATTHEW MONSON, Esq. — 2024-2025 Louisiana Claims Association Claimsperson of the Year

**Post 1 — Quintessa callout (verbatim, LinkedIn — tagged Louisiana Supreme Court, Louisiana State Bar, Louisiana Department of Insurance, Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board):**
> *"Quintessa Marketing is at it again! 'Only pay for signed retainers'. Of course, nothing is being done about this by our regulatory agencies. What is being pitched is the same thing MMA did that was criticized by Louisiana Judges and is currently being investigated by authorities. This is a Facebook ad in Louisiana."*

**Post 2 — On criminal penalties (verbatim):**
> *"It is time to criminally penalize attorney lead generators who violate attorney advertising rules. There should also be a private right of action against the lead generator and attorney for each [violation]."*

**Barry Zalma, Esq., CFE** (commenting on Monson's post):
> *"Is anyone stupid enough to pay for barratry? Is any police agency aware this is soliciting a crime called runners or cappers depending on the jurisdiction?"*

**Scott Toner, Attorney** (same thread):
> *"My spam email box is full of similar things… it's almost like the attorneys who go along with this have gotten too lazy to do their own illegal solicitation."*

---

### JIMMY G. — Commenting on Darl Champion's Case Connect post

Verbatim:
> *"Case Connect should be sued for fraud by the Texas attorney general."*

---

### BARRETT ROBIN, Attorney — Commenting on Champion's post

> *"For a profession that largely regulates itself through state bar associations, it's kind of amazing these leadgen scams have become so prolific. If tort reformers really want to rein things in, they ought to go after these companies that are encouraging bogus claims."*

---

### The Darl Champion/Ryan McKeen cross-post

Champion, commenting on McKeen's thread:
> *"Thank you for sharing! This is a big problem. The ads are getting more and more misleading. I posted a video discussing one ad in particular that was filled with false statements."*

This exchange — two well-followed PI attorneys publicly endorsing each other's concerns about lead gen advertising — represents the emerging attorney consensus: **the advertising that generates leads is a liability, not just an inconvenience.**

---

## Part 2: Review Platforms — Aggregate Attorney Sentiment

### MARTINDALE-NOLO (SiteJabber — documented 1.3/5 aggregate)

**Verbatim August 2024 review:**
> *"Complete waste of money and time. Was promised refunds for leads that didn't convert to paying clients. When all leads failed to convert, Martindale-Nolo refused to issue credits, calling the experience a 'complete waste of money.'"*

**Documented pattern across reviews:**
- *"Non-exclusive leads sold to multiple attorneys simultaneously"* — one attorney reports being *"the 8th attorney to call a prospect within 30 minutes"*
- One lead's case description literally read: *"Pro bono"*
- Leads described consistently as people *"seeking free legal advice with no ability to pay"*

---

### NOLO (Trustpilot — 1.4/5, 125 reviews)

**Documented themes:**
- Leads described as *"garbage"*
- *"Non-exclusive"* — same lead sold to multiple firms
- Same prospect receiving calls from *"8+ attorneys"* in rapid succession
- *"Seeking free legal advice"* — no ability to pay for representation

---

### FINDLAW (Trustpilot — 3.2/5, 46 reviews; ComplaintsBoard — 1.0/5, 16 complaints, 0% resolution)

**Verbatim 2024 Trustpilot review:**
> *"Zero legitimate leads — only spam and scam contacts — and absolutely no return on investment since May 2024."*

Additional documented complaint: account told it would be paused in September 2024, continued receiving monthly invoices and late fee charges with no explanation, escalation requests went unanswered despite persistent collection calls.

**From legalmarketingreview.com:** Multiple attorneys discovered their FindLaw-built website content was *"duplicated word-for-word across other law firm sites, except for names."*

**Verbatim from a FindLaw internal employee** (reported by an independent marketing consultant):
> *"His managers have absolutely no clue what they're doing with SEO... most of their clients don't get results."*

---

### THE $60,372 CASE STUDY — Vaziri Law

**Source:** Documented in category research (Session 01/02); referenced in Shotton behavioral analysis
$60,372 spent on FindLaw over a period of months → 271 leads → zero signed cases.

This is the category's most cited data point among attorneys who have decided to leave the directory model. It's referenced not as an outlier but as a representative experience.

## Part 3: Podcast Voices — Practitioners Who've Operated in the Industry

### RICHARD JACOBS — Speakeasy Authority Marketing Podcast
*Previously operated myduiattorney.org; delivered 35,000+ leads over 11 years*

On the "secret re-sell" practice (verbatim):
> *"What a lot of these companies do, even if they tell you it's exclusive, is resell leads to other attorneys. Do you know why? Because some attorneys who are bad about answering their phone or answering texts will complain that all the leads are garbage. It's the attorneys' fault, not the lead providers' fault. I used to have to do this sometimes. You would allow people to pay a lot more for exclusive leads, and if they didn't convert them, they wouldn't stay a client very long. Or, you would have to offer the leads to other people after a few minutes if the first attorney didn't answer..."*

On real lead quality at scale (verbatim):
> *"The average was three in 10 leads were viable. That was the max. The rest were ghosts, not qualified, in the wrong practice area, wrong geography, freebie seekers, or something else was wrong with them. If you're paying $50 a lead, that really means you're paying $150 per viable lead, approximately. You are not paying $50 a lead. But if you close one in 10, which is the average we saw... then you need to know that you're not paying $50 a client, you're paying $500 to get a client."*

On the 24/7 burden (verbatim):
> *"What this does is put you on call 24/7. You may want to get leads only during office hours, but sometimes it doesn't work like that. If you're paying for them, then you're paranoid about every lead that you don't answer, so you always have to be Johnny-on-the-spot and answer that phone. If you're at dinner, if you're hanging out with your spouse, if you're going for a walk, you can never rest, which is terrible."*

On "hopium" marketing (verbatim):
> *"Everyone wants new clients, and everyone wants more clients. Unfortunately, no one really wants to squeeze the juice out of the lead flow they're already getting... There are plenty of marketers who know hopium is one of the most addictive drugs out there, so they'll pitch you and sell you on all kinds of stuff. They will say they're going to unleash a flood of new business into your practice and that you're going to get three more clients a week or 12 more clients a month. Reality check: all you need to do is pay this service, and all of a sudden, your practice is going to double or triple? It's just not going to happen, I'm sorry."*

His verdict (verbatim):
> *"Paid lead pushers are bad news. It's not a way to build a law practice. It'll take you out of the mindset of doing a good job because you'll always be looking for that next hit. It stops you from pursuing referral strategies. It even leads to people building up huge receivables... they're just looking for that next crack hit. Don't let the paid lead pushers push you around."*

### GRACE & LIEL LEVY — In Camera Podcast (Season 5, Episode 19: "Fake Leads")

*Liel Levy is co-founder of Nanato Media and author of Beyond Se Habla Español*

Liel Levy, on whether lead gen can ever be a winning strategy (verbatim):
> *"You can make money with lead generation companies, but you cannot win with lead generation companies, if that makes sense. Right? You can certainly run your law firm profitably with lead generation companies, but you cannot win on the long term because you're basically not having a business because you're relying on them. So if they stop delivering, if they go out of business, if they found a better client that they want to support more than your firm, you are suffering and it's out of your control."*

Liel Levy, on firms that do succeed:
> *"Firms that in addition of doing their single event business that have built strong brands in their markets, they tend to do very well on the mass torts side of things... Because they're already trusted, known."*

Grace, on why law firms fund other brands instead of their own (verbatim):
> *"You're spending money on something that's never going to give you as a firm, as your company, the view into the leads. So the leads come in under a general brand under someone else's brand. So you're paying for someone else to increase their brand awareness. Why would you do that?"*

## Part 4: What Attorneys Are Saying About the Advertising Itself

This is the highest-signal section for Second Chair's positioning. The attorneys who are most vocal are not upset about lead prices or conversion rates. They're upset about the advertising. And they're connecting it directly to their professional identity.

---

### The Core Statement of the Problem

**Ryan McKeen, verbatim:**
> *"What lawyer wants a client with those expectations?"*

**Darl Champion, verbatim:**
> *"Do you really want to start off the attorney-client relationship that way?"*

**Barrett Robin, verbatim:**
> *"If tort reformers really want to rein things in, they ought to go after these companies that are encouraging bogus claims."*

These are not abstract ethics concerns. They're practice management concerns. The advertising sets client expectations. Misleading advertising creates clients with wrong expectations. Wrong-expectation clients generate complaints, malpractice risk, and professional shame. Attorneys know this. And they can't opt out of it if they buy leads without reviewing the advertising.

---

### The Professional Identity Undercurrent

No attorney on record says: *"I don't like these ads because they violate Rule 7.1."* That's the legal frame. The human frame is different.

What they actually say:
- *"These modern snakeoil salesmen aren't just harming the public. They're harming lawyers, too."* (Champion)
- *"I am out of adjectives to describe this race-to-the-bottom advertising."* (Schwartz)
- *"This is so painful to watch."* (Dianna Mason Horacek, same thread)

"Snakeoil salesmen." "Race to the bottom." "Painful to watch."

These are identity words. An attorney who feels like a snakeoil salesman has lost something beyond a marketing budget. They've lost the self-concept of the lawyer they wanted to be. That's Jon Steel's insight made concrete: the category has taken the good feeling about how attorneys get clients. The attorneys who speak up most loudly are the ones who feel it most acutely.

---

### The Implicit Market Ask

What attorneys in these discussions are asking for — without anyone having delivered it yet:

**Ryan McKeen, verbatim close:**
> *"But if I were buying personal injury leads right now - I would be very careful in who I was using and I would demand to know exactly what they are doing on my behalf."*

**Darl Champion, verbatim:**
> *"Before using any lead generation services, verify what they are doing to generate those so-called leads."*

**Kimberly DeCarrera, verbatim:**
> *"Stay on top of the tactics, the messages, and demand the results."*

Three senior attorneys, on the record, are asking for the same thing: **a lead gen vendor who will show them the advertising.** Not describe it. Show it. Let the attorney verify what is being run on their behalf.

This is Second Chair's positioning claim made as an explicit market demand by the attorneys Second Chair is trying to serve.

---

## Part 5: What Attorneys Say Is the Switching Trigger

The clearest documented switching triggers, assembled from attorney commentary:

**Trigger 1: Getting burned on lead quality**
The Vaziri Law $60,372 example represents a pattern. The trigger is typically a specific, financially painful experience — not gradual dissatisfaction. The attorney reaches a breaking point (often a monthly bill that produces a bad CPSC calculation) and actively searches for alternatives.

**Trigger 2: A peer recommendation**
Ryan McKeen's 60-comment thread is itself a switching trigger — when a respected peer publicly names a problem and names specific patterns to avoid, attorneys use that as permission to investigate alternatives. One vocal peer recommendation is worth more than significant direct outreach.

**Trigger 3: A compliance concern becoming real**
Matthew Monson's public warning about Quintessa's model tagged regulatory bodies. Attorneys reading that post are now holding a specific concern: *"Am I buying from a vendor whose model is under regulatory investigation?"* This is an active switching trigger for any attorney with bar compliance concerns.

**Trigger 4: The advertising itself becoming embarrassing**
Darl Champion's call to action — *"Rejecting these services isn't just the right thing to do, but ask yourself: what quality of client and case are you getting with someone who was duped into hiring you?"* — is a trigger frame. An attorney who sees their current vendor's consumer advertising for the first time and is embarrassed by it has reached a tipping point.

---

## Part 6: What Attorneys Would Actually Trust

From aggregate community voice, the structural characteristics of a vendor attorneys would trust (explicitly or implicitly stated):

1. **Shows the advertising** — Ryan McKeen: *"I would demand to know exactly what they are doing on my behalf."*
2. **Honest about what leads are** — Richard Jacobs: vendors that name real viable rates (30%, not 98%) earn the trust that unrealistic claims destroy
3. **Named, verifiable references** — the absence of named client references is universally noted; attorneys verify with peers, not testimonial sliders
4. **Compliant structure** — bar-safe contractual structure explicitly noted as a requirement by compliance-aware attorneys
5. **CPSC reporting** — attorneys who've been burned measure success at signed case level, not lead delivery level; vendors that report on the right metric signal alignment

The gap these requirements describe: **a vendor that is confident enough in their process, their advertising, and their results to make all of it visible.**

No current vendor meets all five criteria. Second Chair is designed to.

---

## Part 7: The Trust Hierarchy — What Attorneys Recommend to Each Other

When attorneys recommend marketing approaches to each other in online discussions, the hierarchy is consistent:

**Gold standard:** Referrals — attorney-to-attorney, chiropractor referrals, relationship-based
**High trust:** Google Local Services Ads — platform-mediated, pay-per-contact, Google-verified
**Moderate trust:** Owned SEO and content — long build time, durable asset
**Low trust:** Any purchased lead program — the subject of virtually every critical discussion
**Lowest trust:** Shared leads from directory aggregators; pay-per-signed-retainer models with bar compliance concerns; offshore coached-lead vendors

**Liel Levy (In Camera Podcast) on what wins:**
> *"Firms that in addition of doing their single event business that have built strong brands in their markets, they tend to do very well... Because they're already trusted, known."*

The attorneys who succeed with lead gen long-term — per practitioner consensus — are those who supplement owned channels (brand, referrals, SEO) with purchased leads, rather than those who depend entirely on purchased leads.

**What this means for Second Chair:** The attorney community's ideal partner is not a vendor who replaces their other channels. It's a vendor who makes purchased lead gen credible enough to complement their existing strategy — honest advertising, verifiable results, accountable to CPSC, and compliant with the bar rules their licenses depend on.

## What They Are

Zero Risk Torts is one of the largest-scale signed retainer operations in the PI lead generation category. Their defining characteristic is documented volume: **1,997,508 total cases originated since 2004** across their PI and mass tort divisions. That's nearly 2 million cases over 22 years — a data point that puts them in a completely different operational category than most competitors.

They operate two distinct divisions under the same compliance infrastructure:
- **ZeroRiskTorts.com** — Personal injury (MVA primary)
- **ZeroRiskCases.com** — Mass tort (active campaigns: Ozempic, Roundup, PFAS, Depo-Provera, others)

## What They Sell

**Personal Injury Signed Retainer Packages**

Like other Tier 2B vendors, Zero Risk Torts delivers fully signed plaintiff packages — not raw leads. Each package includes:
- Completed intake documentation
- Signed retainer agreement
- HIPAA release forms
- Call recordings
- ZeroRisk Compliance Program™ verification

**The ZeroRisk Compliance Program™** is their differentiated compliance layer:
- TrustedForm consent verification on every lead
- STIR/SHAKEN caller ID protocol compliance
- Timestamped opt-in records
- Documentation provided to law firm clients with each case

**Sourcing Channels:**
Google, Facebook, Instagram, TV, radio (English and Spanish), and OTO (Over-The-Top) streaming platforms. Multi-channel sourcing is a meaningful operational advantage — they don't depend on any single media channel for lead volume.

**Mass Tort Division Scale:**
- 54,711 signed cases through Q1 2025
- Active campaigns as of early 2026: Ozempic/GLP-1, Roundup, Suboxone, Tylenol, PFAS/water contamination, asbestos, surgical mesh, Depo-Provera

## Pricing

Not publicly listed. Contact 833-ZERORISK for quote. The volume of their operation suggests pricing comparable to or above other Tier 2B vendors ($2,500–$6,500/signed PI case), but the mass tort division may operate on different economics (campaign-specific pricing per tort type).

---

## Their Positioning Claims

- "Signed Personal Injury Leads. ZeroRisk Compliance Program. Pay for signed cases, not leads."
- TCPA-compliant, fraud-free, high-intent signed claimants nationwide (November 2025 GlobeNewswire press release)
- TrustedForm compliance documentation with every case
- Multi-channel sourcing (Google, Facebook, TV, radio, OTO)
- 1,997,508 total cases originated since 2004

## Known Law Firm Clients

Not named publicly. The scale of their operation (2M+ cases, 22 years in market) implies significant relationships with large PI and mass tort firms. Law firms at the Plaintiff's Steering Committee level in mass tort litigation are likely clients — the volume of signed mass tort cases (54,711) requires large-firm buyers.

---

## What Attorneys Say

No significant public attorney reviews found — consistent with the B2B-only, high-price-point positioning of Tier 2B vendors. Attorneys who evaluate at this level do so through internal due diligence, not public review platforms.

The documented scale (2M cases originated, 22 years operational) is the primary credibility signal. In a market full of vendors making unverifiable performance claims, Zero Risk Torts' documented case volume is among the few provable differentiators in the category.

## Business Model Analysis

**How they make money:** Per-signed-case fees across PI and mass tort verticals. Mass tort provides diversification — when MVA case values are stable, mass tort campaigns can produce significant volume spikes depending on active litigation cycles.

**The compliance infrastructure as moat:** The ZeroRisk Compliance Program™ with TrustedForm, STIR/SHAKEN, and timestamped consent records is a meaningful competitive barrier. Smaller vendors cannot easily replicate a compliance infrastructure that's been built and tested at 2M+ case volume. Under the FCC's 2024–2025 one-to-one consent rules, this infrastructure is not just a differentiator — it's potentially a survival requirement.

**The mass tort hedge:** Mass tort is a volatile, high-value adjacent vertical. When a major tort emerges (Ozempic litigation, PFAS, Roundup), volume spikes dramatically. A vendor with established intake infrastructure and law firm relationships can capture enormous revenue from these spikes. Zero Risk Torts' ability to run both PI and mass tort gives them revenue diversification that pure PI vendors lack.

**The volume risk:** At 2M cases originated, maintaining qualification standards is operationally complex. There's an inherent tension between scale (volume drives revenue) and quality (excessive volume can dilute per-case value). This tension is the core challenge of any high-volume intake operation.

---

## Their Model's Weaknesses

1. **Opacity at scale:** With nearly 2M cases originated, how does a law firm evaluate the quality distribution of those cases? The aggregate number is impressive; the per-case quality is unknowable without an existing relationship.

2. **UPL proximity:** Same risk as all signed retainer vendors. Executing retainer agreements at scale across 50 states requires careful legal architecture in each jurisdiction.

3. **Mass tort volatility:** Mass tort campaigns are tied to litigation cycles. A case category that's hot today (Ozempic) can cool rapidly when an MDL is consolidated, damages are capped, or a settlement is reached. Vendors heavily weighted toward mass tort ride a volatile revenue cycle.

4. **No pricing transparency:** Despite 22 years in market and 2M cases as credibility anchors, Zero Risk Torts still doesn't publish pricing. In a market shifting toward transparency, this is an increasingly visible gap.

5. **Brand opacity:** For a company that's been operating since 2004 with 2M cases originated, they have remarkably low public profile. Limited press coverage, limited attorney community mentions, minimal social media presence. The brand is not built for inbound interest — it's built for outbound sales relationships.

## The Strategic Data Point

Zero Risk Torts represents the institutional scale of what this market supports. If a vendor has been running for 22 years and originated 2 million cases across PI and mass tort — at an estimated $2,000–$6,000 per signed case — the implied cumulative revenue from that volume is in the billions of dollars. This is not a cottage industry.

For Second Chair: the existence of Zero Risk Torts at this scale confirms that the signed retainer model is commercially durable and scalable. The market supports institutional players in this space.

---

## Second Chair Competitive Take

Zero Risk Torts operates at a scale Second Chair is not competing with today. But their existence in the market is a strategic reference point: the category supports signed retainer delivery at enormous volume, and compliance infrastructure is the operational moat that makes it defensible.

The long-term read: as Second Chair scales, building TrustedForm documentation, TCPA compliance architecture, and consent verification into the product early is not just ethical — it's a competitive moat that compounds over time.

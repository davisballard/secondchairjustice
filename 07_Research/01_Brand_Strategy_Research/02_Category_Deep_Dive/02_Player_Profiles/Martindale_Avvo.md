## What They Are

Internet Brands is the consolidated owner of the largest network of legal information properties in the United States. Under one corporate roof, they own:

- **Martindale.com** — America's oldest attorney directory (founded 1868)
- **Avvo** — Attorney review platform and Q&A marketplace (acquired 2018)
- **Lawyers.com** — General legal directory
- **Nolo** — Legal self-help content publisher (founded 1971; acquired by Internet Brands)
- **Ngage Live** — 24/7 live chat service for law firm websites

The combined footprint reaches **11+ million consumers monthly** looking for attorneys. This is not a small operation — it's the largest aggregation of legal audience in the country.

## What They Sell

**Product 1: Directory Advertising**
Attorneys pay for enhanced profile placement within Martindale, Avvo, and Lawyers.com. Basic profiles are free. Premium placement ("connect" subscriptions, sponsored placements, "Top Rated" badges) costs money. The theory: more prominent placement = more profile views = more inbound contacts.

**Product 2: LeadDirect (Pay-Per-Lead)**
A separate product from directory advertising. Martindale delivers real-time, exclusive leads to a single attorney per geography. 55+ practice areas. Leads include contact information and, when applicable, chat transcripts from Ngage Live interactions. No long-term contracts required.

Martindale's own performance claim for LeadDirect: average of 6 leads needed to sign one PI client (implying a ~17% conversion rate). This is higher than the industry average, which makes it a marketing claim, not a verified external figure.

**Product 3: Ngage Live (Chat → Phone Transfer)**
A 24/7 staffed live chat layer deployed on attorney websites, Avvo listings, Lawyers.com profiles, and social media channels. Engages website visitors in real-time, captures contact info, and facilitates warm phone transfers. Also available as a standalone "Direct Leads" service — fixed cost-per-lead with no contracts.

## Their Positioning Claims

- "Grow your practice with confidence."
- LeadDirect: "Exclusive, vetted leads delivered in real-time."
- Self-reported: 11M+ monthly legal consumers; 1.2M+ attorney profiles; 55+ practice areas

## Known Law Firm Clients

No named PI firm clients in public case studies. The scale claim (1.2M+ attorney profiles) means virtually every PI attorney in the country has some relationship with the Martindale ecosystem — either as a listed profile or as a former buyer of their advertising products.

## What Attorneys Say

**Martindale-Nolo combined on Sitejabber: 1.3/5 stars** — one of the lowest satisfaction scores of any vendor in the category.

Selected attorney verbatim reviews:
- *"Falsely claim they will credit back for leads that do not lead to paying clients. False. Complete waste of money and time, as every single 'lead' was a person wanting free legal advice who had no money to hire an attorney."*
- *"They charged me $300/month for profile management and I received 2 leads in a year, both spam."*
- *"I was sold on the promise of exclusivity. I later found out the same lead went to multiple attorneys."*

**Third-party analysis (Everest Legal Marketing):** A Martindale directory presence generates only 50–150 website visits per year per attorney profile despite thousands of dollars in annual spend. The visitors who do arrive show quality signals (1:30–3:00 minute average dwell time), but volume is too low to justify cost for most firms.

**Reddit attorney forums:** Martindale, along with FindLaw and Nolo, are consistently cited as "wastes of money" by PI attorneys. The specific complaint is that directory visitors skew toward people researching a legal question, not actively seeking to hire an attorney.

## Business Model Analysis

**How they make money:** Subscriptions and PPL. Revenue is not contingent on attorney outcomes — it's contingent on attorneys staying enrolled. This is the core structural problem.

**The incentive gap:** Internet Brands' revenue model requires attorneys to believe they're getting value from directory exposure. It does not require attorneys to actually sign cases from directory leads. Once enrolled, the switching cost (rebuilding an Avvo profile, losing review history) provides retention even for dissatisfied clients.

**The consolidation problem:** An attorney paying for Martindale, Avvo, and Nolo is effectively paying the same company three times. Internet Brands benefits from this perception of diversification while the attorney is actually buying from one vendor.

**The aging moat:** Their competitive advantage — enormous directory audience — is eroding structurally. Claimants now find attorneys through Google Local Service Ads, AI Overviews, and Google Search rather than navigating to a legal directory first. The directory model was built for a search ecosystem that is rapidly changing.

## Their Model's Weaknesses (For Second Chair's Positioning)

1. **Outcome decoupling:** They make money whether you sign cases or not. Second Chair's success is tied directly to lead quality that produces signed cases.

2. **Legacy technology:** Avvo, Martindale, and Nolo are built on aging platforms. The user experience is not competitive with modern search and discovery tools.

3. **The trust score is public:** 1.3/5 on Sitejabber is not a hidden fact. Attorneys who search "Martindale reviews" see this before calling. This creates a pre-call credibility problem.

4. **They can't serve one firm per market:** The directory model serves all attorneys in all markets. By definition, it cannot offer exclusivity — it's selling exposure, not relationships.

5. **TCPA risk:** Shared lead programs without individual TrustedForm consent are now legally problematic. Internet Brands' scale makes a blanket compliance pivot operationally difficult.

## Second Chair Competitive Take

Martindale-Avvo is the market's status quo — and its best argument for why status quo is broken. Every attorney who's been burned by a directory subscription is a warm prospect for a model that aligns vendor success with attorney success. The 1.3/5 satisfaction score is not an edge case; it's a category indictment.

**The positioning move:** Second Chair doesn't need to attack Martindale by name. It just needs to represent everything Martindale is not: outcome-aligned pricing, exclusive territory, creative-quality leads, and a vendor that measures success in signed cases, not profile views.

## What They Are

Settlement Allies (operating as GetSignedCases.com and Accident Payments) is a pre-signed MVA retainer delivery service. Like Quintessa, they don't sell leads — they sell signed retainer agreements. Unlike most vendors in this tier, they are one of the few to publish pricing publicly.

Their distinguishing characteristic: **fully public, per-state pricing for signed cases.** This makes them the most transparent vendor in the Tier 2B signed retainer category — and one of only a handful of vendors in the entire market willing to disclose per-unit cost.

---

## What They Sell

**Pre-signed MVA retainer packages** — exclusive, never resold after signing.

The pipeline they run:
1. Identify and target accident victims through digital advertising
2. Follow up across multiple channels until qualified and engaged
3. Qualify using standard MVA filters (fault, injury, SOL, representation status)
4. Execute a signed retainer agreement with the claimant
5. Deliver the signed case file to the law firm

**Key feature:** Attorneys can review and approve the case before payment is required. This is a meaningful trust signal — the attorney sees what they're buying before the transaction is complete.

**Coverage:** 50 states. Nationwide operation.

**Volume claim:** 1,000+ qualified leads per month across their network.

## Pricing (Published — One of the Only Vendors to Do So)

| State | Price Per Signed Case | Volume Example |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|
| Minnesota | $2,500 | 26 cases closed |
| Washington | $3,500 | 43 cases closed |
| Oregon | $6,500 | 31 cases closed |

The state-by-state pricing variance (2.6x range from MN to OR) reflects media cost, case average value, and competitive density by market. Oregon's significantly higher case values (higher average PI settlements) justify the higher price per signed case.

## Their Positioning Claims

- "We Deliver Signed MVA Clients — Not Just Leads."
- Exclusive cases — never resold after signing
- Review-before-pay: attorney approves case before payment
- 50-state coverage
- 1,000+ qualified leads per month

---

## Known Law Firm Clients

Not named publicly. Testimonials on site:
- *"Outsourcing our sales operations through Accident Payments felt like adding a trained sales team."*
- *"Transparency, professionalism, and higher-quality cases compared to shared lead vendors."*

The testimonials reference the operational value (sales team outsourcing) and comparative quality advantage over shared lead vendors — both of which are commercially meaningful claims, even without named clients.

## What Attorneys Say

No significant negative independent reviews found. The positive testimonials on site emphasize two themes: (1) the transparency advantage compared to opaque shared lead vendors, and (2) the time savings from outsourcing the intake conversion process.

The review-before-pay feature addresses the #1 attorney objection to signed retainer pricing — "what if the case is garbage?" — by creating a verification layer before money changes hands.

## Business Model Analysis

**How they make money:** Per-signed-case fee across 50 states. Volume is the growth driver — more states, more cases, more revenue.

**The transparency bet:** In a category where 65% of vendors hide pricing, publishing state-by-state pricing is a deliberate positioning move. It signals confidence in the product's value and reduces buyer friction at the evaluation stage.

**The review-before-pay mechanic:** This is unusual in the category and meaningful for attorney trust-building. The attorney knows before paying that the case meets their standards. This reduces risk perception and makes the $2,500–$6,500 price point feel more defensible.

**The state variance challenge:** $6,500 in Oregon vs. $2,500 in Minnesota is a pricing structure that's difficult for attorneys to internalize. An attorney with offices in multiple states needs a different budget line per state — complex to forecast and manage.

---

## Their Model's Weaknesses

1. **State pricing unpredictability:** The 2.6x variance across states makes budget forecasting difficult for multi-state firms. Attorneys planning expansion may face sticker shock when entering a high-cost state.

2. **UPL exposure:** Same risk as all signed retainer vendors — the intake team obtaining signatures is performing functions legally adjacent to attorney intake. In states with strict UPL enforcement, this requires careful compliance architecture.

3. **Volume concentration risk:** "1,000+ qualified leads per month" is a small number across 50 states. Depending on how this volume is distributed, individual state markets may see low monthly case volume — limiting utility for firms that need high-frequency lead flow.

4. **Signed case quality verification:** Even with review-before-pay, the attorney can only verify what's in the intake file — not the claimant's actual commitment to follow through with the case. Signed retainer ≠ case that produces revenue. Drop-off between signing and active case participation is a real attrition factor.

5. **No named client references:** The lack of publicly named clients (in a business where "which firms trust you" is a major credibility signal) limits their ability to sell through social proof.

## The Key Data Point

**Published volume examples:**
- Minnesota: 26 cases closed at $2,500 = $65,000 in revenue
- Washington: 43 cases closed at $3,500 = $150,500 in revenue
- Oregon: 31 cases closed at $6,500 = $201,500 in revenue

These are small absolute numbers — suggesting this is either a newer operation or one where volume per state is intentionally limited (like Quintessa's one-firm-per-market model, but with a smaller number of total exclusive relationships).

---

## Second Chair Competitive Take

Settlement Allies demonstrates that transparent pricing in the signed retainer tier is viable and compelling. Their approach — publish the price, let attorneys verify before paying, deliver nationwide — is the right commercial instinct. Their weakness is brand visibility and named client references.

**The strategic signal:** If Second Chair ever moves toward a signed retainer or nurtured lead product tier, the Settlement Allies model shows that transparent, per-unit pricing with a review mechanic is the right commercial architecture. The attorney's trust is built through transparency, not through opacity.

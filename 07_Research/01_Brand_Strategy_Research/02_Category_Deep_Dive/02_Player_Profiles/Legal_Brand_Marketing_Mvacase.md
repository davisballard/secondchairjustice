## What They Are

Legal Brand Marketing is the parent agency. MVACase is their specialized MVA lead product — and notably, one of the very few vendors in the entire category to publish pricing publicly. In a market where 65% of vendors hide pricing behind a sales call, MVACase's public pricing page is itself a positioning statement.

They provide a bundled service: exclusive MVA leads + the full digital marketing stack (Google Ads management, Facebook Ads, SEO, website, CRM tools, content marketing, analytics) in a monthly subscription package.

*Month-to-month agreements. No long-term contracts.*

**For context within the category:**
- This pricing puts MVACase squarely in the upper tier of Tier 1B exclusive raw lead vendors ($300–$850/lead range)
- At $350/lead exclusive, they're above Second Chair's current $400/lead price in cost-per-lead, but the bundle includes more services
- The effective cost is actually lower if attorneys would otherwise be paying for Google Ads management separately

**Legal Brand Marketing's general pricing (published separately):**
- Shared leads: $50–$150/lead
- Exclusive leads: $250–$600+/lead (varies by geography, quality filters, delivery speed)

## What Attorneys Say

**Generally positive** — MVACase's pricing transparency is consistently cited by attorneys and legal marketing analysts as a differentiator in an otherwise opaque market.

No significant negative independent reviews found. The lack of named clients and independent verification of performance claims (340% lead increase, $50M+ in client revenue) limits the ability to validate results externally.

**The key attorney observation about MVACase in the market:** Before calling, attorneys can calculate expected ROI. $7,000/month → 20 exclusive leads → if 20% convert → 4 signed cases → at $15K average attorney fee per case → $60,000 in fees/month from $7K invested. That math is possible because they publish numbers. Most competitors cannot be evaluated this way.

## Business Model Analysis

**How they make money:** Monthly subscriptions (recurring revenue). Month-to-month terms reduce sticker shock but also mean monthly churn risk.

**The bundling bet:** By including all digital marketing services in one package, MVACase reduces attorney decision complexity and becomes their single point of contact for lead generation. This creates stickiness — the attorney isn't just buying leads, they're offloading their entire digital marketing operation.

**The transparency strategy:** In a category where pricing opacity is standard, publishing pricing allows MVACase to pre-qualify buyers before the first conversation. Attorneys who call them already know what it costs. This means faster sales cycles and less friction from pricing objections.

**The constraint:** The bundled model means attorneys pay for everything whether they need it or not. An attorney with an established website and strong Google Ads management already in place is paying for duplicate services. The bundle creates value for attorney who want one vendor for everything; it creates perceived waste for attorneys who want to optimize individual channels.

## Their Model's Weaknesses

1. **No performance-based pricing:** $3,500–$7,000/month is the same price whether the leads convert or not. The subscription model shares the same outcome-decoupling problem as directory vendors — just at a higher price point with better leads.

2. **Bundling inefficiency:** Attorneys who don't need SEO, website, or CRM tools are effectively subsidizing those services for other clients. The best-fit buyer is an attorney with no existing digital marketing infrastructure who wants a single-vendor relationship.

3. **Self-reported metrics:** "340% lead increase," "98% satisfaction," and "$50M+ in client revenue" are claims with no independent verification mechanism. In a category where trust is everything, unverifiable claims create skepticism among sophisticated buyers.

4. **$350/lead is not premium pricing:** At $350/lead exclusive, MVACase is solidly mid-market on CPL. Attorneys evaluating them against signed retainer providers ($2,500–$6,500/signed case) will still need to run their own intake and conversion — making the value comparison complex.

5. **No named clients as social proof:** With 500+ claimed law firm clients, the absence of named, verifiable case studies is a missed opportunity for building trust.

## Second Chair Competitive Take

MVACase is the closest analog in the market to Second Chair's current price point and positioning. Both are exclusive MVA lead providers at roughly $350–$400/lead. The key differences:

| Dimension | MVACase | Second Chair |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Differentiator | Pricing transparency + bundled services | Creative Advantage — agency-grade advertising quality |
| Bundle | Everything-included (ads + SEO + CRM + website) | Lead generation as primary product |
| Pricing model | Monthly subscription ($3,500–$7,000) | Per-lead |
| Performance claims | Self-reported, unverified | — |
| Named clients | None public | — |

**The strategic implication:** MVACase proved that pricing transparency is a defensible differentiator. Second Chair can match or exceed this transparency while adding the Creative Advantage differentiation — quality that MVACase's claims don't specifically address. MVACase talks about lead volume (340% increase). Second Chair can talk about lead quality (behavioral science, higher-intent claimants, better campaign creative).

The conversation to win against MVACase: "They give you more leads. We give you better ones."

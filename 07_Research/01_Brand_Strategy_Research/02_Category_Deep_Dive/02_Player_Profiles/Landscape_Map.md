## How to Read This Map

Players are organized by their primary business model and delivery tier. Within each tier, they're sorted by pricing transparency (public pricing first, then quote-only). Individual deep-dive profiles are in `02_Player_Profiles/[COMPANY_NAME].md`.

Pricing ranges are drawn from public sources where available and from market benchmarks and third-party aggregator data where not. All ranges should be verified before use in any sales or positioning context.

## TIER 1 — Raw / Shared Lead Providers

**What they sell:** Web form leads or inbound calls, ranging from shared (sold to 3–5 firms simultaneously) to exclusive (sold once). Minimal to no qualification beyond self-reported form answers. Attorney's intake team handles all conversion.

**Price range:** $30–$850/lead
**Who buys them:** Solo practitioners, small firms that lack in-house marketing. Also large firms buying volume.
**Where they sit on the value chain:** Stages 1–2 (Awareness → Capture only)

### 1A. DIRECTORY AGGREGATORS
*Own their own audience through content. Sell access to that audience.*

| Company | URL | Pricing | Model | Rating |
|---------|-----|---------|-------|--------|
| **Martindale-Avvo / LeadDirect** | martindale-avvo.com | From $5/lead (PPL); LeadDirect: quote-only ~$100–$350/lead est. | Directory + PPL | 1.3/5 ⚠️ |
| **FindLaw** (Thomson Reuters) | findlaw.com | $2,000–$5,000+/month; ~$223/lead documented | Directory subscription | 2.1/5 ⚠️ |
| **Nolo** (Internet Brands) | nolo.com | $350–$700/month | Directory subscription | 1.4/5 ⚠️ |
| **LegalMatch** | legalmatch.com | From $455/month | Matching marketplace | 4.2/5 (consumer); poor (attorneys) |

**Key observation:** All four run at catastrophic attorney satisfaction scores (sub-2.5/5). The directory model is broadly failing the buyer.

## Second Chair's Position on This Map

**Current delivery:** Stages 1–2 (Awareness + Capture) with premium creative quality at Stage 1. Price point: ~$400/lead (exclusive).

**Competitive positioning within the map:** Second Chair sits in the upper tier of raw/exclusive lead providers (Tier 1B) but has a differentiation story that operates at Stage 1 — the Creative Advantage thesis that better advertising produces higher-intent claimants before they enter the pipeline.

**The map reveals the upgrade path:** Moving from Tier 1B ($400/lead raw exclusive) toward Tier 2A or 2B (live transfer or signed retainer) dramatically increases price, attorney satisfaction, and product stickiness. The operational investment to move up the chain is real; the revenue uplift is substantial.

# Phase 0: Research Agenda Map
## Consumer Deep Dive — V10 Upgrade Pre-Research Brief

**Author:** Julian Cole, Head of Strategy
**Date:** February 2026
**Session:** 01 — Consumer Deep Dive (Upgraded)
**Purpose:** Map specific evidence requirements for each of the 11 expert analysts before any analysis begins. Prevent research gaps. Ensure every agent has what they need to operate at full depth.

> *"The researcher who starts without a research agenda is the researcher who discovers their biggest gap at the end. We map before we dig."*

## Why This Document Exists

The original Session 01 Consumer Deep Dive was B2B-only and produced 9 documents of strong foundational research — particularly on the PI attorney profile, deprivation analysis, and buying behaviors. Sessions 02 (Category) and 03 (Culture) produced additional consumer-relevant material: community voice, claimant cultural world, insurance distrust mapping, behavioral friction analysis.

This upgrade expands Session 01 to:
1. Add full B2C consumer research (accident victim/claimant as the end consumer Second Chair's advertising reaches)
2. Layer individual expert analysis across both B2B and B2C tracks
3. Add round tables, fusion, and synthesis to match the methodology from Sessions 02 and 03

Before any analyst produces output, this document maps exactly what evidence each of the 11 experts needs — what already exists from prior sessions and what genuinely requires new research.

**The rule:** No agent should spend time researching what another session already established. Every agent draws from the full research library (Sessions 01 + 02 + 03). New research is targeted and specific.

## Evidence Gap Analysis — What Requires New Research

Despite three sessions of research, the following genuine gaps exist in the consumer track:

### B2C Gaps (Significant)
| Gap | Why It's a Gap | New Research Target |
|-----|---------------|---------------------|
| Claimant character depth | Culture documented the *cultural context*; no document exists profiling the accident victim as a *person* (like PI_ATTORNEY_PROFILE.md does for attorneys) | CLAIMANT_PROFILE.md |
| Claimant deprivation analysis | Steel's deprivation methodology has not been applied to the claimant — what do they lose by *not* getting legal help? | CLAIMANT_DEPRIVATION_ANALYSIS.md |
| Claimant decision architecture | Culture mapped the cultural barriers; no document maps the *decision journey* in detail — the specific moments, emotions, and triggers | CLAIMANT_DECISION_ARCHITECTURE.md |

### B2B Gaps (Moderate)
| Gap | Why It's a Gap | New Research Target |
|-----|---------------|---------------------|
| Consumer CEP map | Sharp's framework is applied to Category; no document maps the specific Category Entry Points for *both* attorney buyers and accident victim consumers | CONSUMER_CEP_MAP.md |
| Attorney private register (consumer focus) | ATTORNEY_COMMUNITY_VOICE.md (Session 02) captures forum voice re: vendors; no document captures the private language attorneys use about *their own buying decisions* — the private voice of the consumer, not the category critic | Update/extension to community voice |

---

## Evidence Requirements by Agent

### 1. Julian Cole — Head of Strategy
**Role in Consumer upgrade:** Answer the 4Cs consumer questions explicitly for both B2B and B2C. Produce SESSION_INSIGHTS.md in BECAUSE format.

**B2B evidence needs:**
- Attorney buyer journey from pre-awareness to signed contract
- The 4 buyer profiles and which is Second Chair's primary consumer
- CEP timing — when is the attorney most open to switching lead gen vendors
- The stated need vs. the real need (certainty, not leads)

**B2C evidence needs:**
- The accident victim's decision journey (pre-accident to signed retainer)
- The specific barriers that prevent claiming (identity, cognitive, cultural)
- The 72-hour window as a CEP
- What "being made whole" means emotionally vs. financially

**Already covered:** PI_ATTORNEY_PROFILE.md, ATTORNEY_DEPRIVATION_ANALYSIS.md (B2B); CLAIMANT_CULTURAL_WORLD.md, KNOW_YOUR_RIGHTS_CULTURE.md (B2C)
**Still needed:** CLAIMANT_DECISION_ARCHITECTURE.md, CONSUMER_CEP_MAP.md

---

### 2. Byron Sharp — Brand Growth Scientist
**Role:** Map Category Entry Points for both audiences; assess mental availability; identify where Second Chair's brand needs to be present.

**B2B evidence needs:**
- The specific moments when attorneys mentally enter the "buy leads" category (slow January, post-trial, referral drought, competitor growth)
- What distinctive assets could anchor Second Chair in those moments
- How "honest advertising" functions as a mental shortcut vs. a differentiator

**B2C evidence needs:**
- The moments when accident victims mentally enter the "find a lawyer" category (the accident, the adjuster call, the friend's suggestion, the medical bill)
- What makes a PI brand salient at those moments
- Why most claimants never reach the "find a lawyer" moment at all

**Already covered:** BYRON_SHARP_CATEGORY_ANALYSIS.md (B2B category); CLAIMANT_CULTURAL_WORLD.md (B2C barriers)
**Still needed:** CONSUMER_CEP_MAP.md (both tracks); CLAIMANT_DECISION_ARCHITECTURE.md (B2C CEPs)

---

### 3. Richard Shotton — Behavioral Scientist
**Role:** Map cognitive biases operating in both consumer decisions. Surface the irrationalities. Design nudges.

**B2B evidence needs:**
- Status quo bias in attorney vendor switching (why bad vendors keep getting paid)
- Loss aversion in the purchase decision (pain of losing a bad case vs. joy of a good one)
- Social proof as the primary trust signal in attorney peer networks
- The sunk cost trap (why attorneys keep buying from vendors that have burned them)

**B2C evidence needs:**
- Optimism bias in claimants ("I'm probably fine, I'll be okay without a lawyer")
- Present bias (settlement now vs. better outcome in 18 months)
- Social proof in the claimant's decision (friend says call a lawyer vs. normalization of not claiming)
- Identity conflict as a behavioral barrier ("I'm not the kind of person who sues")

**Already covered:** ATTORNEY_TRUST_AND_DECISIONS.md (B2B biases); RICHARD_SHOTTON_CULTURE_ANALYSIS.md (B2C distrust); RICHARD_SHOTTON_BEHAVIORAL_ANALYSIS.md (category)
**Still needed:** Extension into B2C consumer bias mapping at character level (CLAIMANT_PROFILE.md)

---

### 4. Les Binet & Peter Field — Effectiveness Researchers
**Role:** Apply IPA effectiveness evidence to both tracks. Define what long-term brand building looks like for each audience.

**B2B evidence needs:**
- Evidence on B2B brand building in professional services — what works at what budget level
- The long vs. short balance for B2B legal marketing
- How trust-building campaigns compound over time vs. direct response conversion campaigns
- The fame multiplier in a profession driven by peer influence

**B2C evidence needs:**
- Evidence on advertising effectiveness for legal services to consumers
- Why emotional campaigns outperform rational ones even for high-consideration decisions
- How consistent brand advertising creates the mental availability that makes claimants call Second Chair-sourced attorneys first

**Already covered:** LES_BINET_PETER_FIELD_CULTURE_ANALYSIS.md; LES_BINET_PETER_FIELD_EFFECTIVENESS_ANALYSIS.md (category)
**Still needed:** B2C consumer advertising effectiveness evidence (integrated into CLAIMANT_DECISION_ARCHITECTURE.md)

---

### 5. Adam Ferrier — Behavioral Strategist
**Role:** Build the behavior change architecture for both consumer decisions. Map motivation vs. ability barriers. Design the trigger sequence.

**B2B evidence needs:**
- The full ACT (Action, Context, Trigger) framework for attorney vendor switching
- The specific motivation barriers (why attorneys stay with bad vendors)
- The ability barriers (what makes switching hard even when motivated)
- The trigger events that create genuine switching windows

**B2C evidence needs:**
- The full ACT framework for claimant seeking legal help
- The motivation barriers (identity conflict, minimization, cultural stigma)
- The ability barriers (cognitive load in aftermath, no trusted messenger, no clear first step)
- The trigger events (adjuster call, medical bill arrival, friend recommendation)

**Already covered:** ADAM_FERRIER_CULTURE_ANALYSIS.md (cultural barriers); ADAM_FERRIER_BEHAVIOR_CHANGE_ANALYSIS.md (category); CLAIMANT_CULTURAL_WORLD.md fusion layer (Ferrier's B2C friction map)
**Still needed:** Full behavior change architecture at consumer character level (both tracks, synthesized in individual analysis)

---

### 6. Jon Steel — Narrative Strategist
**Role:** Apply deprivation methodology to both consumers. Find the human truth that should drive creative. Write the character-level story of each consumer.

**B2B evidence needs:**
- B2B deprivation already documented in ATTORNEY_DEPRIVATION_ANALYSIS.md — extend to character-level story of specific personas
- The moment before the attorney calls Second Chair — what is happening in their life?
- What does the attorney tell themselves to justify continuing with a bad vendor?

**B2C evidence needs:**
- Apply deprivation methodology to the accident victim — what do they lose by NOT calling a lawyer?
- The moment before they make or don't make the call — what is happening in their mind?
- What story do they tell themselves to justify accepting the first offer?

**Already covered:** ATTORNEY_DEPRIVATION_ANALYSIS.md (B2B deprivation); JON_STEEL_CULTURE_ANALYSIS.md and CLAIMANT_CULTURAL_WORLD.md (B2C cultural context)
**Still needed:** CLAIMANT_DEPRIVATION_ANALYSIS.md (new document applying deprivation methodology to the claimant directly)

---

### 7. Nigel Bogle — Account Management
**Role:** Assess the commercial viability of insights from both tracks. Define the client relationship model. Translate consumer truth into commercial strategy.

**B2B evidence needs:**
- The long-term value of a PI attorney account (retention economics, LTV calculation)
- What drives account health vs. churn (intake education gap, lead quality perception, CPSC reporting)
- How B2C advertising quality affects B2B account retention

**B2C evidence needs:**
- How claimant advertising effectiveness becomes a B2B selling proposition
- The commercial link between honest B2C advertising and attorney satisfaction with leads
- The risk/reward of competing on advertising transparency in B2B sales conversations

**Already covered:** CATEGORY_CONSUMER_SYNTHESIS.md (commercial tensions); partial in ATTORNEY_TRUST_AND_DECISIONS.md
**Still needed:** Commercial framing synthesized in individual analysis

---

### 8. Richard Roma — VP of Sales
**Role:** Ground every consumer insight in the reality of the sales conversation. What does the research mean for how you sell to a PI attorney?

**B2B evidence needs:**
- The sales cycle for each of the 4 buyer profiles (Tony Reyes the solo, Jennifer Walsh the builder, Marcus Chen the marketing director, Bill Taggart the tired king)
- The specific objection map for each profile type
- What happens in the 60 minutes after the first call — what does the attorney do to verify?
- The language of closing — what words and framings convert skeptical PI attorneys

**B2C evidence needs:**
- How the story of what happens to claimants (the $47K vs. $13K gap, the 72-hour window) functions as B2B sales ammunition
- The sales argument for honest advertising — why it matters to the attorney's business, not just their ethics
- How to use the community voice research (Darl Champion, Ryan McKeen) in sales conversations

**Already covered:** PI_ATTORNEY_PROFILE.md (all 4 profiles); ATTORNEY_TRUST_AND_DECISIONS.md (purchase dynamics); ATTORNEY_COMMUNITY_VOICE.md (community voice)
**Still needed:** Sales-specific synthesis in individual analysis

---

### 9. John Hegarty — Executive Creative Director
**Role:** Test the creative potential of both consumer characters. Find the "zag" in both B2B and B2C. Challenge strategic assumptions where needed.

**B2B evidence needs:**
- Is the PI attorney a compelling creative character? Where is the unexpected angle?
- What would make the attorney lean forward in B2B advertising?
- What is the single most unexpected, true thing about PI attorneys that nobody else is saying?

**B2C evidence needs:**
- Is the accident victim a compelling creative character? What is their most human, unexpected truth?
- What is the "zag" in PI advertising to claimants — what would honest PI advertising actually look and feel like?
- What cultural reference points could make PI advertising feel different?

**Already covered:** JOHN_HEGARTY_CULTURE_ANALYSIS.md (cultural creative potential); CLAIMANT_CULTURAL_WORLD.md (claimant reality); PI_ATTORNEY_PROFILE.md (attorney character)
**Still needed:** Creative read on both consumer characters at the full-depth level (individual analysis)

---

### 10. Ed McCabe — Senior Copywriter
**Role:** Extract the verbal identity for both audiences. Find the headlines. Compress the consumer truth into copy that works.

**B2B evidence needs:**
- The exact language PI attorneys use when they trust a vendor vs. when they don't
- The headline that makes a PI attorney stop scrolling
- The vocabulary of B2B honesty — what words signal transparency to a burned buyer

**B2C evidence needs:**
- The exact language accident victims use in their moment of decision ("made whole," "I just want to be fair," "I don't want to be that person")
- The headline that makes an accident victim feel seen rather than sold to
- The vocabulary that creates identity permission ("protecting what's yours" not "you deserve to sue")

**Already covered:** ED_MCCABE_CULTURE_ANALYSIS.md ("made whole," Reddit vocabulary, "Proud" one-word brief); PI_ATTORNEY_PROFILE.md Part 6 (attorney vocabulary)
**Still needed:** Consumer-specific copy architecture in individual analysis; B2B headline tests

---

### 11. Graham Fink — Senior Art Director
**Role:** Read both consumers visually. Map the visual landscape each audience lives in. Design the visual zag for Second Chair in both contexts.

**B2B evidence needs:**
- What does legal B2B marketing look like visually — the clichés, the conventions, the visual language that every vendor uses
- What visual language signals credibility to a professional services buyer in 2026
- What would Second Chair's B2B visual identity look like against the field

**B2C evidence needs:**
- What does PI advertising to consumers look like visually — the conventions (scales of justice, sad faces, personal injury billboards)
- What visual codes make accident victims feel seen vs. exploited
- What honest PI advertising looks like when it's actually honest

**Already covered:** GRAHAM_FINK_CULTURE_ANALYSIS.md (visual monoculture map; visual zag; visual codes of trust); COMPETITOR_AD_AUDIT.md (what the category looks like)
**Still needed:** Consumer-specific visual character read in individual analysis; B2B visual identity recommendations

## Research Sequencing — Phase 1 New Research Targets

Based on the gap analysis, Phase 1 new research focuses on:

### Priority 1 — B2C Character Research
**Target:** Deep research on accident victim psychology, post-accident decision-making, and the human experience of "lumping it"
**Key questions to answer:**
- Who is the accident victim as a person before the accident? (demographics, life context, financial reality)
- What is their physical and cognitive state in the 72 hours after an accident?
- What does the decision NOT to call a lawyer feel like from the inside?
- What would change their mind? What has worked in advertising research?
- What does it feel like 12 months later when the first offer wasn't enough?

**Sources to investigate:** Academic literature on accident victim psychology; consumer behavior research in personal injury; legal decision-making studies; advocacy organization research (AAAJ, injury law academic papers)

### Priority 2 — B2B CEP Timing Research
**Target:** Specific timing and trigger data for attorney buying windows
**Key questions to answer:**
- What specific events reliably open an attorney's buying window? (documented patterns)
- How long does a typical buying window last before it closes?
- What is the seasonal pattern of attorney marketing spend decisions?
- What does the attorney do in the 24 hours before making a purchase decision?

**Sources to investigate:** PILMMA conference dates and patterns; legal marketing budget cycles; bar association event calendar; seasonality overlap with accident rates

### Priority 3 — B2C Deprivation Research
**Target:** The emotional and financial experience of accepting an inadequate settlement
**Key questions to answer:**
- What happens to accident victims who accepted the first offer 12 months later?
- What do they wish they had known? (documented testimonials, advocacy research)
- What is the "I should have called a lawyer" moment — when does it crystallize?
- What is the financial cascade from inadequate settlement (medical debt, missed work, inability to cover ongoing treatment)?

**Sources to investigate:** Legal advocacy research; medical debt studies; patient testimonial research; State Bar client protection reports

## Quality Standard — V10 Criteria

Every document in this session must meet the following standard:

1. **Sourced.** Every data point cited with publication and date. No unsupported assertions.
2. **Specific.** No "attorneys feel burned by lead gen" without a specific quote, a specific dollar amount, or a specific behavioral study.
3. **Dual-tracked.** Every strategic analysis addresses both B2B attorney and B2C claimant unless explicitly scoped to one track.
4. **Cross-referenced.** Insights in individual analyses reference specific source documents by name. The research library is cited, not assumed.
5. **Creative-ready.** Every analysis ends with implications that a creative team can act on. Facts without implications are just filing.
6. **Fused.** After round tables, core documents are updated with FUSION LAYER sections that integrate round table decisions and additional insights.

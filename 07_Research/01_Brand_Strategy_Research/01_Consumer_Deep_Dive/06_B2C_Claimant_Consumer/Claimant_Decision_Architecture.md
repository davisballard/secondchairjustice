## Preamble: The Architecture of a Non-Decision

When we study why more than 90% of accident victims don't seek legal help — despite the documented financial harm of not doing so — we are studying not just a decision but a non-decision. The default. The path of least cognitive resistance in a highly stressful situation.

Understanding that non-decision requires a behavioral science frame, not a rational choice frame. The accident victim isn't failing to seek legal help because they've weighed the options and found legal help lacking. They're failing to seek legal help because the default — accepting the insurance company's framing, moving as quickly as possible toward resolution, avoiding anything that feels like "making a big deal of it" — is the path that requires the least action, the least identity disruption, and the least cognitive effort.

This document maps that architecture. It identifies where the decision happens, what forces are operating at each stage, and what would genuinely change the outcome.

## I. The ACT Matrix Applied to Claimant Decision-Making

### The Three Levers of Behavior Change

Every behavior (or non-behavior) can be understood through three factors:

**Motivation** — Do they want to do it? (Values, emotions, attitudes)
**Ability** — Can they do it? (Skills, knowledge, cognitive capacity, logistics)
**Trigger** — What prompts the specific action at the specific moment? (Environmental cues, timing, social prompts)

For accident victims seeking legal help:
- **Motivation barriers** are primarily about identity and values ("I'm not the kind of person who sues")
- **Ability barriers** are primarily about cognitive load and knowledge gaps ("I don't know how it works or what to do first")
- **Trigger failures** are about timing and messenger ("The adjuster calls first; nobody else prompts them")

An effective B2C advertising strategy addresses all three. An ad that only addresses motivation ("You deserve justice!") without addressing ability ("Here's how: one call, 10 minutes") and without creating a trigger ("Call now before you sign anything") will fail to move behavior even when it changes attitudes.

## II. Stage-by-Stage Decision Map

### Stage 0: Pre-Accident — The Consumer Before the Event

**What's happening:**
The future accident victim is living their life. They have no active motivation to learn about PI law. They have no established mental framework for what to do if they're in an accident. They may have seen PI attorney advertising — billboards, TV spots — but it has not been encoded as relevant information. It's background noise.

**What the research shows:**
- Most consumers can name a PI attorney brand (Morgan & Morgan, 1-800 injury ads) without being able to describe what they do or why they'd call vs. handling a claim themselves
- Legal help is not a category most people have thought through in advance — it's a decision made under crisis conditions with no preparation
- The "Know Your Rights" cultural shift (TikTok legal content) is building some baseline legal literacy, particularly among under-35s (Session 03, KNOW_YOUR_RIGHTS_CULTURE.md)

**Behavioral Science Lens (Shotton):**
Pre-accident is when *priming* works. If a consumer has been exposed to the idea that "before you say yes to anything from an insurance company, make one call" — even in a relaxed, non-crisis moment — that exposure creates a cognitive scaffold that becomes available when the crisis arrives. This is why Brand advertising before the crisis moment is not wasted — it's investment in mental availability (Sharp's CEP principle).

**Advertising Implication:**
Pre-accident advertising can't create urgency (there's no urgency yet). It can create priming: a simple, memorable instruction that will surface when needed. "One call before you decide" encoded before the accident is the equivalent of a mental first-aid kit.

### Stage 1: The Accident — The Crisis Moment

**What's happening:**
The accident has just happened. The victim is in shock — physiological stress response, elevated cortisol and adrenaline, reduced cognitive capacity. They are simultaneously managing physical reality (pain, confusion, the scene of the accident) and the social reality of the moment (other people involved, bystanders, emergency services).

**Behavioral barriers at this stage:**
- **Cognitive shutdown**: Stress hormones impair prefrontal cortex function — the part of the brain that does deliberate decision-making. This is not metaphorical impairment. It is literal neurological reduction in the capacity to make good decisions.
- **The "I'm fine" reflex**: Culturally trained minimization activates immediately. Social norms suppress expression of pain and injury in public settings. The accident victim says "I'm fine" because appearing fine is the socially appropriate response.
- **Information vacuum**: Nobody at the accident scene is providing relevant legal information. Police are managing safety. Emergency services are managing medical needs. The at-fault driver's insurance, which will be the most aggressive information provider, hasn't called yet.

**What would change behavior at this stage:**
Nothing that requires decision-making. The cognitive capacity simply isn't there. The intervention at Stage 1 is environmental: if emergency services routinely provided accident victims with a card that said "Before you talk to any insurance company, call [number]. It's free and takes 10 minutes" — the trigger would exist at the moment it's needed. This is systemic infrastructure, not advertising.

**Advertising Implication:**
You can't advertise effectively at the moment of the accident. The audience is not reachable, not receptive, and not capable of processing decision-making information. Don't try.

### Stage 2: The Immediate Aftermath — Hours to 72 Hours

**What's happening:**
The victim is out of the acute crisis. They're at home, at the hospital, or recovering. The pain is setting in — or not, if soft tissue injuries (which often have delayed symptom onset). They're dealing with immediate logistics: vehicle, work notification, family. They are also being actively contacted by the at-fault driver's insurance adjuster.

**The adjuster's call dynamics:**
The adjuster calls within hours to 72 hours. This is the most important window in the entire claims process, and it is owned by the insurance company. The adjuster:
- Calls first, setting the conversational frame
- Is warm, sympathetic, and professional — trained to reduce the victim's defenses
- Asks open-ended questions designed to elicit statements that limit liability
- Often seeks permission for a recorded statement (often granted, because the victim doesn't know not to grant it)
- May make an initial verbal offer or suggest a settlement timeline

The adjuster's call is the most effective intervention in the entire claims process. It occurs at exactly the right moment (when the victim is receptive and unrepresented), with exactly the right messenger (official, legitimate, authoritative), delivering a framing that serves the insurance company's interests while appearing to serve the victim's.

**Behavioral barriers at this stage:**
- **Authority bias**: The adjuster represents an official institution. Their framing of the situation is automatically more credible than an unverified alternative frame.
- **Reciprocity**: The adjuster has been "helpful" — they called first, they offered assistance. Basic social reciprocity makes the victim feel obligated to cooperate.
- **Cognitive load**: The victim is managing multiple logistics simultaneously. Adding "I should also call a lawyer" to the list is one more item on an already overwhelming agenda.
- **Identity conflict**: If the adjuster's framing is accepted ("let's resolve this efficiently so you can move on"), calling a lawyer means disrupting that frame and identifying as someone who is making a "big deal" of the situation.

**What would change behavior at this stage:**
A competing first-contact from a trusted messenger. The adjuster calls first — what if a second contact followed within the same 72-hour window, from a source the victim trusts, with a competing frame?

The competing frame is: "Before you agree to anything, find out what you have. One call, 10 minutes, no cost."

**Advertising Implication:**
Timing-targeted digital advertising in the 24-72 hour post-accident window is the most valuable B2C advertising Second Chair can run. If someone has been in an accident (search signals, location data, or direct trigger from news-of-accident), the advertising that reaches them in this window with a minimum viable action instruction ("one call before you decide") is competing directly with the adjuster.

The advertising doesn't need to be complex. It needs to be timely and simple.

### Stage 3: The Research Phase — Days to Weeks

**What's happening:**
The victim has survived the first 72 hours. They may or may not have spoken to an attorney. They are now in a period of active consideration — not necessarily about legal representation specifically, but about how to handle the situation generally. They are:
- Researching their symptoms and prognosis
- Processing ongoing communication with the insurance company
- Talking to people in their social network (family, friends, coworkers) about what happened
- Receiving medical care and beginning to understand the scope and timeline of recovery
- Googling things — their injury, the adjuster's name, "how much is my car accident worth," "should I call a lawyer"

**The digital behaviors:**
Search data suggests that post-accident searches typically follow this pattern:
1. **Medical searches**: "whiplash symptoms," "cervical strain recovery time," "can I still have pain after car accident"
2. **Insurance searches**: "how does insurance claim work," "what is an adjuster," "how long does a claim take"
3. **Legal searches**: "should I get a lawyer for car accident," "how does car accident lawyer work," "do I need a lawyer for minor accident"

The progression from medical to insurance to legal searches typically spans 3-14 days. The legal search moment is the highest-intent moment in the digital journey — the moment the victim is actively asking whether they need help.

**Behavioral barriers at this stage:**
- **Information overload**: Legal search results are dominated by attorney ads making maximalist claims. The victim who is looking for honest information finds it hard to identify credible sources. The noise-to-signal ratio is very high.
- **Social proof uncertainty**: What are people like them doing? Are they unusual for considering a lawyer? Or unusual for NOT considering one? The social norm is ambiguous — most of the people they know directly don't talk about their PI experiences openly.
- **Status quo momentum**: The adjuster's framing has been established. The claim is "in process." Changing course feels like disruption rather than optimization.

**What would change behavior at this stage:**
Credible, specific information delivered in the right format for the research behavior. In digital search: content that answers the specific question being asked ("do I need a lawyer for a car accident?") honestly, without making maximalist promises, and that provides a clear minimum viable next action. Social proof from people who look like the victim — not testimonials from winners who got millions, but stories from regular people who "just wanted to know what they had" and found out the settlement offer was less than their expenses.

**Advertising Implication:**
Search ads, YouTube pre-roll, and TikTok content in this research window should target the specific search queries the victim is using. Not "we'll get you millions" — but content that actually answers the question "should I get a lawyer?" with honesty: "Here's when it matters. Here's when it might not. Here's what a 10-minute call can tell you."

### Stage 4: The Decision Point — Sign or Wait

**What's happening:**
A settlement offer has been received. The victim is holding a concrete dollar amount and making a decision: accept it, or don't. This is the highest-stakes moment in the entire journey. It is also the moment when legal help becomes irreversible — signing closes the claim.

**What the research shows about the settlement decision:**
- **68% accept the first offer** without consulting an attorney (Benji Personal Injury, 2024–25)
- **Initial offers average 23% of total documented expenses**
- **91% of quick-settlers found their compensation was insufficient** for long-term medical expenses

The behavioral forces at this moment:

**Present bias**: The offer is money now. The alternative is uncertainty later. Even if "later" would be more, "now" is a concrete, available, psychologically compelling fact. Behavioral economics consistently shows that humans discount future rewards dramatically compared to present ones — particularly under financial stress.

**Closure seeking**: The accident was traumatic. The claims process has been stressful. The insurance company has been calling. Signing the offer and being done with it provides psychological closure that has genuine value — even if the economic trade-off is poor. "Just being done with it" is not irrational. It is human.

**Authority cue**: The settlement offer arrives as an official document from an insurance company with a name, a logo, and a dollar figure. It feels like the official resolution of the claim. Rejecting it feels like the aberrant behavior, not accepting it.

**Social pressure**: The adjuster has communicated (sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly) that the offer is fair and that the process is complete. Accepting is cooperating. Not accepting is disagreeing.

**Loss framing deficiency**: The victim is thinking about what they gain by accepting (the settlement amount). They are not thinking about what they lose by accepting (the right to any future claim). This is a classic framing failure — the focus is on the gain, not the foregone gain.

**What would change behavior at this stage:**
Loss framing. The advertising or legal outreach that reaches the victim before they sign the offer should reframe the decision: not "you could get more" (gain framing, hard to evaluate) but "before you close this door forever, find out what's on the other side. The door closes when you sign." This is loss framing — and loss framing is 2.5x more motivating than equivalent gain framing (Kahneman & Tversky, Prospect Theory).

Minimum viable action: the one call before signing. Not "hire a lawyer." Not "start legal proceedings." Just: one call, 10 minutes, before you sign anything. This is the smallest possible action that changes the outcome.

**Advertising Implication:**
The B2C ad that works at Stage 4 is the one that reaches the victim before they sign the offer. Timing is everything. The ad that shows up the day after they signed does nothing for them (the claim is closed) and produces only regret. The ad that shows up the day before they were going to sign — with a simple instruction to make one call first — changes the outcome.

---

### Stage 5: The Regret Phase — Months Later

**What's happening:**
The claim is closed. The settlement is spent — or not enough to cover expenses. The injury is ongoing. The full financial impact is becoming clear. This is the "I wish I had called a lawyer" moment documented in the deprivation analysis.

**What's relevant here for advertising:**
Stage 5 victims cannot be helped for their current claim. But they are highly motivated advocates. They are now the most credible voice for legal representation in their social network — more credible than any attorney testimonial. The ad that reaches them — validating their regret, explaining the information asymmetry that trapped them, and asking them to share what they know with someone who might still be in Stage 2 or Stage 3 — creates the most powerful word-of-mouth channel available to Second Chair.

**Advertising Implication:**
Retargeting ads and social content aimed at regret-phase victims should not try to help their claim (they can't) but should validate their experience and activate them as advocates. "You might know someone who just had an accident. Tell them before they sign anything." Social proof delivered peer-to-peer is the most effective mechanism for changing future victims' behavior.

## III. The Friction Map — Specific Barriers and Interventions

| Stage | Specific Barrier | Barrier Type | Intervention |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Pre-accident | No mental scaffold for action | Ability (knowledge) | Priming via brand advertising ("one call before you decide") |
| Accident | Cognitive shutdown; social minimization | Ability (capacity) | Nothing — wrong moment |
| 72-hour | Adjuster first-contact; authority bias; identity conflict | Motivation + Ability | Competing first-contact; minimum viable action instruction; identity reframe |
| Research | Information overload; status quo momentum | Ability (signal/noise) | Specific, honest content answering actual search queries; social proof |
| Decision point | Present bias; closure seeking; loss framing deficiency | Motivation | Loss framing ("before you close this door"); minimum viable action ("one call before you sign") |
| Regret | Claim is closed — too late for them | N/A | Activate as advocates; peer-to-peer social proof |

## IV. The Minimum Viable Action — "One Call Before You Decide"

The entire behavioral architecture of B2C legal advertising comes down to one design principle: **the action asked of the consumer must be the smallest possible action that changes the outcome.**

Calling an attorney feels big. It implies commitment. It implies identifying as someone who is taking legal action. It feels like a big step that ordinary people don't take.

But "finding out what you have before you decide" is not a big step. It's an information-gathering step. It doesn't commit anyone to anything. It doesn't require identifying as a litigant. It doesn't require trust in an attorney — it just requires a willingness to have information before making an irreversible decision.

**The behavioral mechanics of "one call":**
- **Foot-in-the-door**: Asking for a small action (one call, 10 minutes) is far more likely to be granted than asking for a large action (hire an attorney). Once the small action is taken, the probability of the larger action increases dramatically.
- **No identity disruption**: "I'm finding out what I have" does not conflict with "I'm not the kind of person who sues." The identity frame is "informed decision-maker," not "litigant."
- **No financial barrier**: "It costs nothing to find out" removes the ability barrier that many victims assume exists (they assume attorneys charge by the hour; many don't know about contingency fees).
- **Reversible framing**: "Before you decide" implies that they're still in control. They're not committing — they're gathering information. The decision is still theirs.

This single-sentence instruction — "One call, before you sign anything, it's free and takes 10 minutes" — is the behavioral architecture of all Second Chair B2C advertising. Everything else is creative execution around this core.

---

## V. The Social Proof Architecture

Behavioral science consistently shows that the most powerful motivator for uncertain decisions is observing what people like you have done and what happened to them.

For accident victims:
- "Average accident victim without an attorney receives 71% less" — this is comparative social proof (what people like you get without help)
- "8 out of 10 accident victims who called first were glad they did" — this is outcome social proof
- Real testimonials from people who "just wanted to find out" and discovered their initial offer was inadequate — this is narrative social proof

The social proof that works for accident victims is **not** the $10 million verdict story. That story is emotionally engaging but socially irrelevant — the victim cannot identify with a $10 million outcome. They can identify with "I thought the offer was fair until someone showed me it wasn't."

The social proof that works is:
- Same demographics (someone who looks like them)
- Same injury type (relatable, not catastrophic)
- Same hesitation ("I almost didn't call")
- Same fear ("I didn't want to make a big deal of it")
- And a specific, real outcome ("But my injury was going to cost more than the offer covered. I'm glad I found out.")

This is the testimonial architecture for Second Chair B2C advertising. Not victory stories. Recovery stories.

---

## VI. Implications for Second Chair's B2C Strategy

**1. Timing is the most important variable.**
The advertising that reaches the victim in the 72-hour window is worth more than any advertising that reaches them later. Investment in timing-targeted digital advertising (search signals, location-based triggers) should be prioritized over brand awareness spend at this stage of the company.

**2. The minimum viable action is "one call, before you sign."**
Every B2C ad should drive toward this single instruction. The copy, the creative, the CTA — all build to this one action. It's small enough to not trigger resistance. It's large enough to change the outcome.

**3. Loss framing outperforms gain framing for the settlement decision.**
"Before you close this door" is more effective than "you could get more." The irreversibility of signing is the most powerful behavioral lever available. Use it.

**4. Identity reframing makes legal help possible for "I'm not the kind of person who sues."**
The identity barrier is the largest single motivation barrier. Reframe the action as "informed decision-maker," not "litigant." The copy should never say "sue" or "claim" in the first instruction. It should say: "before you decide," "find out what you have," "know what you're giving up."

**5. Social proof from ordinary people is more effective than victory stories.**
The testimonial from someone who got $3.2 million is a category cliché. The testimonial from someone who "almost didn't call" and found out their offer was inadequate is relevant, credible, and specific to the actual decision.

**6. The regret-phase victim is an advertising asset.**
People who went through the experience without legal help and regret it are the most credible advocates available. Activating them — for peer-to-peer referral — is a B2C strategy that costs almost nothing and carries enormous credibility.

## FUSION LAYER — Round Table Enrichment

**Strategy Round Table Decisions (February 2026):**

**The 60/40 B2C budget split maps to the ACT architecture.** Round table decision: 60% to pre-accident brand building (motivation layer — builds permission and priming before the accident); 40% to timing-targeted performance at 72-hour window and settlement offer moment (trigger layer — captures behavior at the CEP). The 60% is Motivation investment; the 40% is Trigger investment. Ability barriers (cognitive load, process ignorance, cost uncertainty) are addressed through the "one call, free, 10 minutes, no commitment" minimum viable action instruction present in all executions.

**"Before you talk to theirs, talk to yours" — the round table headline.** Creative round table produced this line (Hegarty + McCabe): "Before you talk to theirs, talk to yours." This directly addresses Stage 2 of the decision architecture — the adjuster first-contact moment. The "theirs" / "yours" framing assumes the claimant already has an attorney (which they will if they call Second Chair-sourced leads) — creating the correct frame for the action.

**Graham Fink (Creative Round Table):** The decision architecture's visual correlate is the phone being picked up — the hand reaching, the choice being made. This signature image is recommended for the 72-hour window and settlement offer moment advertising. It's an action image, not a condition image, and it encodes the specific behavior: pick up the phone before you sign anything.

**The minimum viable action instruction is non-negotiable.** Strategy round table confirmed: every B2C execution ends with one instruction only. Not "call us today," "visit our website," AND "fill out this form." One instruction: one call, one number, one action. The behavioral design principle — reduce the ask until the barrier disappears — is a creative standard, not just a strategic one.

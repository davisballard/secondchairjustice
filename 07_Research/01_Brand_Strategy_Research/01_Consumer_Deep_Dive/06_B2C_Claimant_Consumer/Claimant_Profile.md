> *"Before we write a single word of B2C advertising, we need to answer one question: who is in the room? Not a 'target demographic.' Not a 'consumer segment.' A person. Someone who was driving to work on a Tuesday and now their life is different. Who is that person, really?"*

## Preamble: Why This Document Exists

The B2B side of Second Chair's business has a detailed consumer profile — `PI_ATTORNEY_PROFILE.md`, 600 lines of Jon Steel's research into who PI attorneys are, what motivates them, what keeps them up at night, what their Tuesday actually looks like.

This document is that same work applied to the other end of the equation: the accident victim. The person whose injury creates the lead that the attorney buys from Second Chair.

That person is not an abstraction. They are not a "claimant." They are someone who was doing something ordinary — commuting, running an errand, picking up their kids — and then something happened that changed their life for months or years. They are now navigating a healthcare system, an insurance system, and potentially a legal system, all simultaneously, while physically hurt, financially scared, and emotionally overwhelmed.

Second Chair will run advertising to reach this person. Understanding who they actually are — their demographics, their financial reality, their psychology, their decision-making patterns — is the foundation everything else stands on.

## Part 1: Who Has Car Accidents — and Who Files Claims

### The Demographics of Accident Victims

The population of people injured in MVA accidents in the United States is broad — roughly 4.4 million Americans are injured in car crashes annually (NHTSA, 2024). But the population that becomes PI claimants — that files an insurance claim, considers calling an attorney, or actually engages legal representation — has specific demographic characteristics.

Research published in *BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders* profiling MVA claimants who seek representation found:
- Mean age approximately **40 years old**
- **75% male** (though this skews by injury severity — catastrophic injuries have a higher male proportion; soft tissue injuries are more gender-balanced)
- **74% employed** prior to injury — meaning the loss of work capacity is a primary financial stressor
- **61% from low-to-middle household income** — meaning they have the most to lose from an inadequate settlement and the least financial buffer to wait for a better one

The California study (Benji Personal Injury, n=1,200 California accident victims, 2024–2025):
- **68% accepted the first settlement offer** without consulting an attorney
- Those who hired attorneys averaged **$47,300** in settlements
- Those who did not averaged **$13,600 — 71% less** for similar injuries
- Initial insurance offers averaged just **23% of total documented expenses**
- **91% of quick-settlers later found their compensation failed to cover long-term medical expenses**

This gap — $33,700 per claimant — is not a legal technicality. It is the financial foundation of Second Chair's B2C advertising purpose.

### The Great Non-Claiming Majority

More than **90% of injury victims "lump it"** — they absorb losses without seeking compensation even when negligence is involved (David M. Engel, *The Myth of the Litigious Society*, University of Chicago Press, 2016). Only approximately **4% hire lawyers**, and **2–3% actually file tort actions**.

This is the paradox at the heart of B2C legal advertising: the people who most need legal help are the least likely to seek it. And the people running the ads — attorneys and their marketing vendors — are the people the culture has taught the public to be suspicious of.

Understanding this non-claiming majority — why they don't call, what it would take to change their minds, and what happens to them when they don't — is the core question for Second Chair's B2C strategy.

---

## Part 2: The Economic Reality They're Living In

Before we understand the accident victim, we need to understand the world they already live in before the accident happens. Because the accident doesn't land on neutral ground. It lands on a person who is already navigating financial anxiety.

### Pre-Existing Financial Fragility

- Americans owe at least **$220 billion** in medical debt (Roosevelt Institute, 2026)
- **Over 100 million Americans** carry healthcare debt
- **66% of Americans** worry about paying for healthcare — more than utilities, food, or housing (KFF Health Tracking Poll, 2026)
- Medical debt is the **leading cause of personal bankruptcy** in the United States

For the accident victim in Second Chair's target demographic — working-class and middle-class, 30-55, employed but not financially cushioned — the accident doesn't create financial anxiety. It transforms existing financial anxiety into financial crisis.

### The Immediate Economic Damage

After a car accident, the economic reality hits in layers:
- **ER visit**: $1,000–$5,000 (typical); can exceed $10,000 with diagnostics
- **Washington State average ER bill**: $1,146
- **Inpatient hospitalization post-MVA**: ~$57,000 average
- **Severe injuries (TBI, spinal cord)**: >$100,000
- **Lost wages**: for the 74% employed prior to injury, every day unable to work is money not coming in
- **Vehicle damage**: the immediate cost that often triggers the first insurance interaction — and sets expectations for how the insurer treats them

A February 2026 study in *Health Affairs* examined what happens financially to trauma patients in the 18 months after injury. The findings, even controlling for insurance status:
- Medical debt in collections rose **5.2 percentage points** — a 24% relative increase
- Average balance in collections increased by **$290**
- **1 in 10** indebted patients owed more than **$4,480** in new collections
- Bankruptcy filings increased **3.2 per 1,000 patients** at approximately 15 months post-injury
- **98% of trauma patients in the study had health insurance** — and still experienced significant financial harm

The ACA enhanced subsidies that buffered healthcare costs expired at the end of 2025, and **33.4% of drivers (1 in 3) in 2023** were uninsured or underinsured — up 10 percentage points since 2017.

This is the economic world the accident victim inhabits. The accident is not an isolated shock. It is a landslide onto an already unstable hillside.

## Part 3: The Person Before the Accident

Effective advertising doesn't show up at the moment of crisis. It shows up in a person's life before the crisis, so that when the crisis arrives, the brand already exists in their mental landscape.

To understand the person Second Chair's B2C advertising needs to reach, we have to understand who they are before anything happens.

### The Working Life

The modal accident victim in Second Chair's target demographic is:

**Employed and commuting.** NHTSA data shows that MVA crashes are most frequent during commuting hours (7-9 AM and 4-7 PM, Monday through Friday) and during errands (midday weekends). The people driving these patterns are workers — people going to jobs, picking up kids, running household logistics.

**Earning, but not cushioned.** The 61% low-to-middle income finding from the claimant demographic research describes people who work full-time and still worry about unexpected expenses. A $2,000 car repair, a missed paycheck, a medical bill — any of these creates real strain. The accident victim is not wealthy enough to absorb the financial impact of an inadequate settlement and not poor enough to have no stake in the legal outcome.

**Unconnected to the legal system.** For most accident victims, the PI attorney will be the first lawyer they've ever spoken to about anything in their own interest. They know lawyers exist — from TV, from friends' experiences, from cultural representation — but the legal system feels like something that happens to other people, or something you get into when you're in trouble.

**Insurance-aware but not insurance-literate.** They have auto insurance. They pay the premiums. They may have filed a small claim at some point. But the mechanics of how insurance companies evaluate and adjuster injury claims — the delay/deny/defend strategy, the recorded statement, the "independent" medical exam — are invisible to them until they need to know them. And they need to know them at exactly the moment they're least equipped to learn: in the days after an accident, when they're in pain, scared, and overwhelmed.

---

## Part 4: The Accident — The First 72 Hours

### What the Immediate Experience Is Like

**The ER** (if injuries warrant it): Rapid, coordinated medical response. Vitals, scans, diagnosis. The medical system appears efficient and caring. The financial implications are invisible in this moment — the priority is physical survival. But the ER visit is already accumulating costs that will arrive in an envelope two weeks later.

**The first call to family**: The victim's first instinct after medical care is social — calling the people who love them. This call establishes the first narrative of what happened. This narrative matters: how the victim describes the accident in the first 24 hours (especially whether they say "I'm fine" or "it wasn't my fault") shapes how they frame the legal question later.

**The adjuster's call**: This typically arrives within hours to 72 hours. Insurance companies know that early contact before legal counsel secures recorded statements that limit liability. The adjuster's performance is measured by minimizing payouts. Their friendly, sympathetic tone is a trained tactic to extract information — particularly a recorded statement — that can be used to reduce or deny the claim later. Legal resources confirm what experienced attorneys know: "Provide only basic details; never agree to recording; don't admit fault; seek medical within 72 hours; consider having adjuster contact your lawyer." (Kaine Law, Legal Reader, Injury.com) But the victim doesn't know any of this when the call comes.

**The "I'm fine" reflex**: One of the most common and most legally damaging things accident victims do is say "I'm fine" at the scene, in the ER, or to the adjuster. This is not stupidity — it's a culturally trained response (don't make a fuss, don't seem like you're looking for a payout) that can be used to minimize compensation later. Soft tissue injuries, which are the most common MVA injuries, often don't produce their full symptom load until 24-72 hours after the accident. The victim says "I'm fine" because, in the immediate aftermath, they feel relatively okay — and this statement follows them through the entire claims process.

**The first settlement offer**: Often arrives before "maximum medical improvement" — before the full extent of the injury is known and before ongoing treatment costs are established. The pressure to accept is highest when bills are arriving and income has stopped or been reduced. An offer that covers the ER bill and the car repair — and represents a concrete, available amount of money right now — is psychologically compelling even if it represents 23% of actual documented expenses.

### The 72-Hour Window

This window — the first three days after the accident — is the most consequential for the claimant's eventual outcome, and the most consequential for Second Chair's B2C advertising reach.

**Evidence deteriorates quickly.** Skid marks fade. Witness memories get murkier. Medical documentation is most useful when gathered early, while the injury is most acute and most clearly causally linked to the accident.

**Legal rights have time limits.** Statutes of limitations typically run two years from the accident date. But many strategic decisions — what statements to make, what documentation to preserve, whether to contact a lawyer — need to happen in days, not months.

**The window when acting is most beneficial is also the window when the victim is least equipped to act.** Pain, medication, fear, and overwhelm all suppress decision-making capacity. This creates the central design challenge for B2C advertising: how do you reach someone in their moment of most need, when they're least able to process complex information?

The answer — and this is the core of Ferrier's behavior change architecture — is minimum viable action. The advertising doesn't need to deliver a legal education in 30 seconds. It needs to deliver one instruction: before you say yes to anything, make one call. One call, 10 minutes, before you decide.

---

## Part 5: The Decision Not to Call

Most people who should call a lawyer don't. Understanding why is the central question for B2C strategy.

### Identity Conflict — "I'm Not That Kind of Person"

The most powerful barrier to claiming is not logistical. It's identity-based. The vast majority of accident victims in Second Chair's target demographic do not identify as people who sue.

"I'm not looking to sue anybody." "I just want to get back to normal." "I don't want to make a big deal of it." These phrases appear across accident victim forums, in legal consultation transcripts, and in research on why people don't claim. They're not statements about the legal system — they're identity statements. The speaker is asserting who they are: not a litigant, not someone who makes problems, not someone who exploits situations.

The "ambulance chaser" cultural narrative — which ironically serves insurance companies by making claimants feel stigmatized for seeking help — has successfully embedded the idea that PI law is for people who want to game the system, not for people who want what's fair. The accident victim who needs an attorney has to overcome their own identity to make the call.

Richard Shotton's research on identity-based behavioral barriers is directly applicable: people avoid actions that conflict with their self-concept, even when those actions serve their concrete interests. The solution is not to argue against the identity ("you should sue") but to reframe the action so it doesn't conflict with the identity ("before you decide anything, just find out what you have — one call, no commitment").

### The Minimization Instinct

Documented across cultural contexts, the minimization instinct drives accident victims to underestimate their own injury and their right to compensation:

- **Collectivist cultures**: In Korean American, Hispanic, and other communities documented in sociolegal research, the instinct not to "make a big deal" of minor accidents overrides the economic interest in claiming
- **Psychological minimization**: "Reduction words" — "no big deal," "only a little," "just" — appear consistently in how accident victims describe what happened to them
- **Religious frameworks**: 1 Corinthians 6:1-8 counsels Christians not to sue other believers; in evangelical communities, these texts create genuine cultural barriers to legal action
- **The physical minimization reflex**: "I'm fine" said at the scene becomes a documented statement that follows the victim through the claims process

The minimization instinct is not stupidity. It is a culturally trained response that protects social belonging, reduces cognitive load, and avoids the stigma of being seen as someone exploiting a situation. Advertising that addresses this barrier directly — without shaming the instinct or lecturing the victim — is the advertising that works.

### Optimism Bias — "It Will Work Out"

Even accident victims who understand they have a claim often don't pursue it because of optimism bias: the well-documented human tendency to believe that our situation will resolve better than base rates would predict.

"The insurance company will be fair." "My bills won't be that high." "I'll recover faster than they're saying." These are not naive statements — they're the default cognitive position of the human brain under uncertainty. We consistently overestimate favorable outcomes and underestimate how long recovery takes and how much it costs.

The 91% of quick-settlers who later found their compensation failed to cover long-term medical expenses were not stupid. They were operating under optimism bias in a situation where the insurance company was specifically trained to exploit it.

### Present Bias — "I Need Money Now"

The first settlement offer arrives at exactly the moment the victim is most financially stressed. Medical bills are accumulating. Missed work is reducing income. The car may be totaled and transportation is a problem. The offer represents a concrete, available amount of money right now.

The legal alternative — engaging an attorney, going through a longer process, waiting 12-18 months for a potentially better outcome — requires the victim to delay present relief for future benefit. Behavioral science consistently shows that humans systematically undervalue future rewards relative to present ones, especially under financial stress.

The insurance company's offer timing is not accidental. It is deliberately structured to activate present bias at the moment it is most acute.

### Cognitive Overload

The accident victim in the first 72 hours is simultaneously managing:
- Physical pain and treatment
- Insurance paperwork and calls
- Vehicle logistics (rental, repair, total loss process)
- Work absence and communication with employer
- Family impact and childcare disruption
- Emotional processing of the accident itself

The decision to call a lawyer is one more item on a list that is already overwhelming. In Ferrier's ACT framework, this is an Ability barrier: even a motivated claimant may not make the call because the cognitive bandwidth to add one more decision is genuinely unavailable. Minimum viable action — "one call, before you decide" — is the only advertising instruction that can penetrate this state.

## Part 6: The Decision-Maker Profiles

Like the PI attorney buyer, the accident victim is not one person. There are four distinct profiles, each requiring a different advertising approach.

---

### Profile A: Maria Delgado, 34 — The Working Parent in Crisis

**Who she is:** Medical assistant at a suburban hospital clinic. Married, two kids (8 and 11). Works 40 hours a week, her husband drives rideshare. Between the two incomes, they cover the mortgage, the car payments, and the kids' activities — but there is no financial cushion.

**The accident:** A car ran a red light and hit her driver's side door on a Tuesday morning commute. She drove herself to urgent care after the accident — she couldn't afford the ER copay. She's been told she has a soft tissue injury to her neck and shoulder. She's in pain. She can't turn her head all the way. She went back to work after two days because she can't afford more time off, but she's struggling.

**The insurance experience:** GEICO called within 24 hours, friendly, sympathetic. They explained she could file a claim against the at-fault driver's insurance — great! The adjuster asked some questions. She answered them honestly, including saying she was "doing okay" and that she had "some soreness." She didn't know about recorded statements. They've offered her $4,200 — it would cover the ER copay, some medical bills, and a little extra. That sounds like a lot of money right now.

**The decision she's facing:** Take the $4,200 now, pay the bills, and try to get back to normal. Or call an attorney and go through a longer process with an uncertain outcome.

**What stops her:** Identity ("I'm not trying to get rich off this"), fear of a long process, fear the attorney will cost more than she gets, and the concrete reality that $4,200 is in front of her and "more money later" is not. Her husband's advice: "Take the money and move on."

**What would move her:** A specific, factual message. Not "you deserve millions" — she would immediately identify that as manipulation. But: "Before you say yes, it costs nothing to find out what your case is actually worth. The average person without an attorney gets 71% less." The number is real. The stakes are concrete. The action is minimal (one call, no commitment).

**What honest advertising looks like for Maria:** Her face. Not a stock photo actor. Someone who looks like her — scrubs, tired, doing the math. The copy doesn't promise a windfall. It promises fairness.

---

### Profile B: DeShawn Williams, 48 — The Breadwinner Who Can't Be Down

**Who he is:** Operates a small HVAC business. Married, three adult children. Has a crew of four employees who depend on his company's income. His work is physically demanding, and he drives a work truck 80+ miles a day.

**The accident:** Rear-ended on the freeway at moderate speed while stopped in traffic. The immediate physical effect seemed minor — some soreness in his neck and lower back. But two weeks later, the pain is worse, not better. His doctor says he has herniated discs at two levels. He'll need physical therapy for months. He can't do the physical work of running jobs. He's had to put his foreman in charge and reduce his own involvement in active jobs — which means he's missing the income that justifies his salary while still paying his crew.

**His situation:** His health insurance has a $5,000 deductible. The at-fault driver has minimum liability coverage ($25,000). His own uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage adds another $50,000. His medical bills are going to exceed $30,000 in the next six months. He did the math and it's not good.

**Why he hasn't called a lawyer yet:** He's a small business owner — he mistrusts anyone who will "take a cut." He's heard PI attorneys take 33%. He's also too busy to deal with it; he's spending his cognitive energy keeping his business running while injured. And there's a pride element: he built something. He doesn't need someone to rescue him. He can handle his own problems.

**What would move him:** A clear explanation of how the math works. "A PI attorney works on contingency — you don't pay unless we win. On average, attorney-represented claimants recover 3.5x more than unrepresented ones. The attorney's fee comes from the additional recovery." For DeShawn, frame legal help not as rescue but as smart business. He would respect a vendor — and an attorney — who explains the math without condescension.

**What honest advertising looks like for DeShawn:** A business frame, not a victim frame. He's not a victim. He's a business owner managing a problem. The ad that speaks to him shows someone handling a situation, not someone being helped out of one.

---

### Profile C: Jennifer Torres, 22 — The Young Driver Who Doesn't Know What She Has

**Who she is:** Recent college graduate, working as a marketing coordinator. Shares an apartment with two roommates. Has some student loans, a used car payment, and is three months into a new job she doesn't want to jeopardize. Her parents are in Mexico — she handles everything herself.

**The accident:** T-boned at an intersection by a driver who ran a stop sign. She went to the ER (her parents insisted over video call). Concussion, laceration on her forehead requiring stitches, soft tissue injury to her shoulder. She's on her employer's health insurance but it's a high-deductible plan — she'll owe a significant share of the ER bill.

**Why she hasn't called a lawyer:** She genuinely doesn't know she should. She's 22. She's never dealt with insurance beyond getting her auto policy. She didn't know there was an option beyond "file the claim and wait for the check." She doesn't know what a PI attorney does, how they get paid, or that the insurance company's first offer might be 23% of what she's entitled to. She's not resisting legal help — she's unaware of it as an option.

**The digital dimension:** Jennifer lives on TikTok. She's seen legal content there — "Know Your Rights" videos, attorney explainers. She's more legally literate than her parents' generation but doesn't translate that literacy into action. The legal information she's consumed is general, not applied to her specific situation.

**What would move her:** Meeting her where she is. Not a TV ad she'll never see. Not a Google search she doesn't know to make. TikTok, Instagram, or a targeted digital ad that shows up in the week after an accident. The ad needs to meet her with honesty about what she doesn't know: "If you were in an accident and haven't talked to an attorney, you may not know what you actually have. Here's what the insurance company isn't telling you."

**What honest advertising looks like for Jennifer:** Vertical video. Real person talking directly to camera, not actor, not stock. She's media-literate enough to know what's performed — she needs someone who sounds like a peer, not an ad.

---

### Profile D: Robert Holtz, 62 — The Retired Driver with Complex Medical History

**Who he is:** Retired schoolteacher. Medicare and supplemental insurance. Has some savings, a paid-off house, and an adult son who handles a lot of his practical logistics. He was a careful driver his entire life.

**The accident:** Hit by a distracted driver on a surface street near his grocery store. Broken wrist, cracked rib, and a head contusion. He was hospitalized overnight. His pre-existing arthritis complicated the recovery — the broken wrist site is healing more slowly than expected. He can't drive, which for someone living independently is a significant functional loss.

**The insurance complexity:** The at-fault driver's insurance is offering a settlement that seems reasonable to Robert — but his attorney son, after doing some research, thinks it drastically undervalues the loss of independence, the extended medical treatment required by his pre-existing condition, and the impact on his quality of life. Robert is inclined to take the offer and be done with it.

**What stops him from pursuing more:** Age and energy. He just wants this to be over. He doesn't want to spend months or years in a legal process. He trusts that "things will work out." He's from a generation that doesn't sue — it feels unseemly. And the insurance adjuster, who has been calling regularly and being very nice, has made the settlement feel like a reasonable resolution.

**What would move him:** His son. Social proof from a peer or trusted family member is the strongest motivator for Robert's demographic. The ad that reaches him isn't to him — it's to his son, or to the friend who suggests he "at least get a free consultation before he signs anything."

**What honest advertising looks like for Robert:** Credibility signals. No flashy graphics. No promises. A calm, authoritative voice that says: "Before you sign, know what you're giving up." The legal fee structure explained in plain terms. The request for a single action: one free consultation.

---

## Part 7: The Language of the Accident Victim

Language reveals belief. The words accident victims use when they're not performing for anyone — in Reddit communities, in patient forums, in the conversations they have with friends — reveal the emotional architecture of the decision.

### The Vocabulary of Unfairness

- **"I just want to be fair about it."** The most common framing. Not "I want to get rich." Not "I want to sue." They want the situation to be resolved in a way that feels equitable. "Fair" is the word that unlocks the door.
- **"I just want to be made whole."** The legal doctrine of "made whole" — being fully compensated before an insurer can recover — appears as a cultural phrase in accident victim discourse. It expresses the moral intuition of PI law: restoration to where you were before someone else's negligence changed it.
- **"I don't want to make a big deal of it."** The minimization instinct in language form. Also: "I don't want to be that person." "I'm not trying to cash in."
- **"The insurance company has been really helpful."** Said by people who haven't yet experienced the gap between the initial offer and what they were entitled to. This is the language of someone inside the optimism bias, before the 18-month reality check.
- **"I wish I had known."** Said by people 12-24 months later. The consistent vocabulary of regret: "I had no idea that's not how it works." "No one told me." "I thought the first offer was what I was owed."

### The Language of Distrust

When accident victims have had a bad experience with the insurance company — or have been warned by someone they trust — the vocabulary shifts:

- **"They're trying to get me to say things."** The recorded statement experience, described with dawning awareness.
- **"They lowballed me."** The vocabulary of the negotiation process, adopted from friends or Reddit threads.
- **"I shouldn't have settled so fast."** The language of the "I wish I had known" category, arrived at sooner.
- **"They keep calling."** The pressure experience — the adjuster's repeated contact — described as something that felt caring but turned out to be strategic.

### The Language of Permission

When accident victims finally call a lawyer, or decide to, the vocabulary changes again:

- **"I just want to find out what I have."** The minimum-viable-action framing. Not "I've decided to sue" — just "I want information."
- **"My friend said I should at least call."** Social permission — the friend or family member who normalizes making the call without pressure.
- **"It costs nothing to find out, right?"** The contingency fee structure, when explained correctly, creates a powerful permission structure. No upfront cost. No risk. The barrier of "what if the attorney charges me?" dissolves when the fee structure is explained.

**McCabe's directive:** Every B2C ad should be working toward giving the accident victim one of two permissions: (1) "finding out what you have" as an identity-safe first step, or (2) social proof that people like them — regular people, not litigants — make this call and don't regret it.

---

## Part 8: The 12-Month Reality Check

What happens to the accident victim 12 months after accepting the first offer?

For the 68% who accepted without legal consultation:
- **91% found their compensation failed to cover long-term medical expenses** — the therapy, the follow-up appointments, the ongoing treatment they didn't know they'd need
- **54% returned to work before doctors recommended** — risking permanent aggravation of their injury because they needed the income
- Medical debt in collections increased significantly, even among those with health insurance
- Bankruptcy filings increased at approximately 15 months post-injury

This is not just a policy problem. It is the emotional material of B2C advertising. The accident victim's 12-month reality check is the story that Second Chair's advertising should tell — not as a horror story, but as the factual consequence of the decision they're being asked to make right now.

The "I wish I had known" moment — when the victim realizes the inadequate settlement won't cover their ongoing costs — is the deprivation moment for the claimant. It's the moment when what they lost by not calling a lawyer becomes undeniably real.

---

## Conclusion: What This Means for Second Chair's B2C Advertising

The accident victim is not an abstraction and not a litigant. They are:
- Financially stressed before the accident happens
- In physical pain and cognitive overwhelm in the immediate aftermath
- Under active, deliberate pressure from an adjuster trained to minimize their claim
- Carrying an identity barrier to seeking help ("I'm not the kind of person who sues")
- Unaware of the $33,700 gap between the outcome with an attorney and without one
- Statistically likely to accept a settlement that fails to cover their costs

Second Chair's B2C advertising serves this person by doing something the category has almost never done: treating them honestly.

Not promising millions. Not exploiting their trauma. Not running "AI compensation calculator" ads that imply government programs. Telling the truth: you may not know what you have. Before you say yes to anything, find out. One call. No cost.

That advertising is honest PI advertising. And honest PI advertising is the B2C expression of Second Chair's brand.

The insightful summary:

> **The accident victim doesn't want to sue. They want to be treated fairly. The attorney who reaches them honestly — before the adjuster does, or before they sign — has already won.**

## FUSION LAYER — Round Table Enrichment

**Strategy Round Table Decisions (February 2026):**

**B2C investment split: 60% pre-accident brand / 40% timing-targeted performance.** The claimant profile research establishes who the pre-accident victim is (before they're a victim). The 60% pre-accident brand investment reaches this person — ordinary, working-class, living their life — with the "one call before you decide" instruction before the accident creates urgency. The profile personas (Maria, DeShawn, Jennifer, Robert) inform which channels reach each demographic group.

**The identity barrier solution applied to each persona:**
- Maria Delgado: Reframe as "smart decision-maker" — she's a medical professional who values information before action
- DeShawn Williams: Reframe as "business decision" — he's an entrepreneur who does math before committing
- Jennifer Torres: Meet on TikTok/Instagram with peer-to-peer format — she's media-literate and responds to authentic digital content
- Robert Holtz: Reach through his son/family — the social referral moment is his primary CEP

**John Hegarty (Creative Round Table):** The "I almost didn't call. I'm glad I did." campaign structure works for all four personas with different executions. Maria's version: "I'm not the kind of person who sues. I just wanted to find out what my case was worth before I signed anything." DeShawn's version: "I thought I could handle it myself. I'm glad someone showed me the math." Jennifer's version: "I had no idea this was even an option. Nobody told me." Robert's: "My son convinced me to make one call first. It made all the difference."

**Graham Fink (Creative Round Table):** No injury iconography. The visual treatment for each persona shows them in their life context, not in their injury context. Maria in scrubs, not a hospital bed. DeShawn at a jobsite, not with a neck brace. Jennifer in a casual setting, not a dramatic ER scene. Robert with his family, not alone in a waiting room.

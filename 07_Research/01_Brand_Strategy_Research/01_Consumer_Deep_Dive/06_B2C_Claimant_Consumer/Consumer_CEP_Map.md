## Preamble: Why CEP Mapping Matters for Both Audiences

Second Chair operates with two consumer audiences that require fundamentally different CEP maps:

**B2B (PI Attorneys):** When do attorneys enter the "buy leads" category? What situations trigger the mental availability of Second Chair?

**B2C (Accident Victims):** When do accident victims enter the "find a lawyer" category? What situations trigger the mental availability of legal representation?

The strategic insight is that these two CEP maps must align: Second Chair's B2C advertising creates the conditions for the attorney's product to be valuable, and the attorney's purchasing decisions create the conditions for Second Chair's B2C advertising to matter.

A brand that understands both CEP maps — and times its B2B and B2C activities accordingly — creates a compounding system. A brand that only understands one misses half the equation.

## PART A: B2B Attorney CEP Map

### What Is an Attorney Category Entry Point?

A CEP for the B2B attorney audience is a specific situation in which the attorney mentally enters the "I need to find or change my lead gen strategy" category. At this moment, Second Chair's mental availability — whether it exists in the attorney's mind — determines whether Second Chair is considered at all.

Brand salience at the CEP is the product. Not preference. Not liking. Presence in mind at the moment of need.

### The 7 Attorney CEPs

**CEP 1: The Slow Month**

*Situation:* Monthly new case intake drops below the attorney's mental threshold for "healthy." This is not necessarily an objective number — it varies by firm — but every PI attorney carries an internal benchmark. When the month's intake falls below it, the "I need more cases" mental category activates.

*Timing:* January-March (seasonal trough, NHTSA data shows February is the lowest crash month nationally — 2,645 fatal crashes vs. 3,505 in October, a 33% swing). Also triggered by any unexpected intake drop regardless of season.

*Behavioral signature:* Attorney starts checking their Google Ads dashboard more frequently. Googles competitors. Asks peers at bar association events what they're doing for marketing. Responds to cold outreach that would normally be ignored.

*CEP window:* 2-4 weeks of below-threshold intake before the attorney takes action. Short enough to target; long enough for brand recall to matter.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* This is the highest-volume CEP — it happens to every PI attorney, multiple times per year. Mental availability here = being considered. Mental unavailability here = invisible.

---

**CEP 2: The Referral Drought**

*Situation:* An attorney's primary referral source reduces or stops sending cases. This is typically a catastrophic event — many PI attorneys get 50-70% of their best cases through referrals. When the referral pipeline dries up, the emotional response is severe (see ATTORNEY_DEPRIVATION_ANALYSIS.md — Mike Morse's "70% of referrals vanished overnight" experience).

*Timing:* Unpredictable — referral sources change without warning. But there are patterns: practice area shifts (a medical provider who stops referring because of a billing dispute), relationship deterioration, geographic moves, retirement of a key referral attorney.

*Behavioral signature:* High urgency, high emotional valence. The attorney is not browsing options — they are actively seeking solutions. This is the CEP with the highest switching intent and the lowest price sensitivity.

*CEP window:* 1-2 weeks. The urgency is acute. Decisions are made fast, often suboptimally.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* High-intent window but emotionally volatile. Messaging must be calm, credible, and specific. The attorney in referral drought is not looking for a sales pitch — they're looking for a lifeline.

---

**CEP 3: Post-Trial Recovery**

*Situation:* An attorney has just completed a major trial. During litigation, their marketing and business development activities typically cease — the trial consumes everything. After the trial (win or lose), there is a 2-4 week window where the attorney is:
- Grateful the trial is over and energized
- Aware that their case pipeline is depleted (cases that were in pre-lit may have stalled during the trial preparation)
- Evaluating their business development options

*Timing:* Follows completion of any significant litigation. More common in Q4 (case timelines often converge on fall trial settings).

*Behavioral signature:* Reflective state. The attorney is often in "what do I want my practice to look like going forward" mode — more strategic than reactive. More open to longer-term partnerships than quick fixes.

*CEP window:* 2-6 weeks. Longer than the panic CEPs; more time for relationship building.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* Premium positioning opportunity. The attorney is in a receptive state for a thoughtful pitch. This is the CEP where Second Chair's story — honest advertising, quality leads, the long-term partnership — resonates most.

---

**CEP 4: The Competitive Disruption Event**

*Situation:* Something in the competitive landscape creates urgency for the attorney to change their marketing strategy. Examples:
- Morgan & Morgan opens an office in their market
- A competitor firm launches a major TV advertising campaign
- A neighboring attorney buys leads and visibly grows their practice
- A technology change (e.g., Google's AI overview affecting organic search traffic) reduces inbound inquiries

*Timing:* Unpredictable but identifiable. Market events are typically trackable — billboard launches are visible, competitor growth is discussed in the local bar community.

*Behavioral signature:* Fear-driven or competitive-driven urgency. "They're growing and I'm not." "The landscape is changing and I'm stuck."

*CEP window:* 1-3 months following the competitive event.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* The competitive equalizer positioning is most relevant here. The implicit message: "You don't need $240M in TV spend. You need a consistent, qualified lead flow." This CEP is where "David vs. Goliath" framing resonates with the attorney's self-identity as a fighter for the underdog.

---

**CEP 5: Partnership Formation / Firm Expansion**

*Situation:* The attorney is bringing in a new partner, adding associates, opening a new practice location, or otherwise expanding capacity. Expansion creates both the need for more cases and the confidence to invest in lead gen (because there's now capacity to work more leads).

*Timing:* Year-round but slightly more common in Q1 (new-year planning) and Q3 (mid-year assessment).

*Behavioral signature:* Optimistic, planning-oriented. The attorney is thinking about the future and investing in growth, not managing a current crisis.

*CEP window:* 3-6 months (expansion planning horizon).

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* Growth positioning. The attorney who is expanding doesn't want to talk about surviving — they want to talk about scaling. Second Chair's scalable, exclusive lead flow is a growth story, not a crisis solution.

---

**CEP 6: Bad Vendor Experience**

*Situation:* The attorney has just had a definitively bad experience with a current lead gen vendor — a month of garbage leads, a compliance scare, a billing dispute, or discovering that "exclusive" leads were being sold to multiple firms.

*Timing:* Triggered by specific negative events, not predictable on a calendar.

*Behavioral signature:* High anger, high switching intent, low patience for another sales pitch. The attorney is in "I'll never use them again and I need something better" mode.

*CEP window:* 2-4 weeks immediately following the bad experience. After that, the urgency fades and status quo reasserts.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* Highest conversion opportunity if Second Chair reaches the attorney in this window. The message must be about verification and transparency — exactly what the angry attorney wants: "Show me exactly how you generate leads. Show me the advertising. Let me verify before I commit to anything."

---

**CEP 7: Legal Marketing Conference Attendance**

*Situation:* The attorney attends PILMMA (Personal Injury Lawyers Marketing and Management Association), Trial Lawyers Associations, or similar conferences. These are active learning/buying environments — attorneys expect to evaluate vendors and make purchasing decisions.

*Timing:* PILMMA annual conference typically Q2; state and regional associations throughout the year.

*Behavioral signature:* Peer-influenced, open to comparison, buying-intent present (they brought the business card, they attended the marketing track). Social proof from other attorneys at the conference is the highest-credibility signal available.

*CEP window:* The conference ± 2 weeks.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* Physical presence and peer introductions are the only advertising format that competes with the conference floor recommendation. If a respected attorney at PILMMA says "I've been using Second Chair and here's what happened" — that is more valuable than any digital campaign.

## PART B: B2C Accident Victim CEP Map

### What Is a Claimant Category Entry Point?

A CEP for accident victims is a specific situation or moment in which an accident victim mentally enters the "should I call a lawyer" category. These moments are not equally distributed across the accident aftermath — they cluster at specific decision points, and missing them means the advertising arrives too late.

### The 5 Claimant CEPs

**CEP 1: The 72-Hour Window — Pre-Adjuster**

*Situation:* The period between the accident and the insurance adjuster's first contact. This is the highest-value window because the claimant has not yet been framed by the insurance company's narrative.

*Timing:* 0-72 hours post-accident. The adjuster calls within 24-72 hours; the window is the period before that call.

*Behavioral signature:* Pain and confusion. Googling symptoms, googling "what to do after a car accident." Social consultation (calling family and friends). Low legal literacy — they know they "should do something" but don't know what.

*CEP window:* Very short — hours to days. The most valuable advertising moment and the hardest to reach at scale.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* Proximity advertising (geo-targeted near accident sites) and search trigger advertising ("what to do after car accident" queries) are the primary mechanisms. The message must be minimal and clear: "Before you talk to their insurance company, get a free consultation. 10 minutes. No cost."

---

**CEP 2: The Adjuster First-Contact — Active Negotiation Awareness**

*Situation:* The victim has spoken with the adjuster and is now aware that there is a negotiation in progress. The framing has been set by the adjuster, but the claim is not yet closed.

*Timing:* 1-7 days post-accident, following the adjuster's first call.

*Behavioral signature:* The victim knows the claim is "in process." They may be starting to research on their own — what their injury typically settles for, whether they need a lawyer. They are in "gathering information" mode.

*CEP window:* 1-3 weeks. This is the highest-volume reachable window — the claim is open, the victim is researching, and the decision is not yet final.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* Search advertising targeting post-accident research queries is the primary mechanism. Content that honestly answers "do I need a lawyer for a car accident?" without making maximalist promises. Loss framing: "Before you accept anything, know what you're giving up if you sign."

---

**CEP 3: The Settlement Offer Arrival**

*Situation:* The victim has received a settlement offer and is deciding whether to accept it. This is the moment of maximum leverage — the decision is pending, it's irreversible if made, and the victim is actively considering.

*Timing:* 2-6 weeks post-accident for minor injuries; longer for more significant injuries.

*Behavioral signature:* High stakes, time pressure (the adjuster is following up). The victim has a concrete number in front of them. They may be asking friends, Googling comparables, or looking for a reason to accept and be done.

*CEP window:* 1-2 weeks around offer receipt. The highest-intent, highest-conversion window.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* Urgency-framed advertising: "Before you sign anything, make one call." The message is explicitly about timing — the door closes when you sign. Loss aversion framing: "Once you sign, you can't reopen this claim."

---

**CEP 4: The Medical Bill Arrival**

*Situation:* The full scope of medical costs has become clear — either through ongoing treatment, specialist referrals, or the arrival of bills that exceed what the settlement covered. The victim is experiencing the gap between what they received and what they need.

*Timing:* 2-6 months post-accident.

*Behavioral signature:* Financial stress, growing awareness that the settlement was inadequate. Googling "what if insurance settlement wasn't enough," "can I reopen a car accident claim," "medical bills more than settlement."

*CEP window:* Ongoing, but concentrated around bill receipt and when medical treatment costs escalate.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* For victims who haven't signed yet, this is still an active opportunity. For victims who have signed, this moment can activate them as advocates. Content addressing this search behavior ("What happens if your car accident settlement doesn't cover your bills?") can capture both groups.

---

**CEP 5: The Social Referral Moment**

*Situation:* Someone in the victim's social network mentions their accident and is asked about it. A family member, friend, or colleague — knowing the victim had an accident — says "Have you talked to a lawyer?" This is the highest-trust CEP because it comes from someone the victim trusts.

*Timing:* Can happen at any point in the journey — days after the accident or months later.

*Behavioral signature:* The social referral lowers every behavioral barrier simultaneously: the identity barrier (if my friend thought to call, it's normal), the ability barrier (my friend might know someone/how), the motivation barrier (I trust this person's judgment).

*CEP window:* Immediately following the social recommendation.

*Second Chair's CEP relevance:* This CEP cannot be manufactured by advertising directly, but it can be enabled: B2C advertising that creates memorable, shareable social proof ("did you know you should call before you sign anything?") creates the vocabulary for peer-to-peer referral. It also provides the referral-ready content for regret-phase victims to share.

## PART C: The CEP Intersection — Where B2B and B2C Alignment Creates Compounding Value

### The Strategic Opportunity

The deepest insight from mapping both CEP calendars is that they can be deliberately aligned:

**When B2C advertising produces leads in attorney CEP windows, the attorney's conversion rate increases.** An attorney in a "slow January" CEP is more motivated to work every lead. An attorney at the PILMMA conference who knows their ads are being run honestly is more likely to recommend Second Chair.

**When attorney buying CEPs coincide with high-accident seasons, Second Chair's B2B outreach is more effective.** The spring/summer spike in accidents creates more B2C leads, which creates more proof of concept for B2B sales conversations.

### The Seasonal Alignment

NHTSA crash data shows accident volume peaks May-October (summer and fall driving). Attorney buying window peaks (slow months) are January-March. The apparent mismatch is actually an opportunity:

- **January-March (attorney slow season):** High attorney receptivity to lead gen conversations. Lead volume is lower (fewer accidents), but the attorney's emotional state is most open to purchasing decisions. This is the window for Second Chair's B2B sales outreach.

- **May-October (accident season):** Lead volume peaks. Attorneys who signed up in January-March are now seeing high-volume, high-quality return on investment. This is the window for B2B retention and case studies.

- **October-December:** Settlement season. Cases signed in spring/summer are resolving. Attorneys are seeing the ROI on their lead gen investment. This is the window for renewals, referrals, and conference presence.

This seasonal calendar creates a year-round rhythm for both B2B and B2C advertising investment.

### The Network Effect

As Second Chair builds a network of attorneys running honest B2C advertising:
- More accident victims receive better information pre-claim
- Better-informed victims call attorneys sooner
- Attorneys receive higher-quality leads (claimants who haven't already signed settlement agreements)
- Attorneys achieve better case outcomes from honest-expectation clients
- Attorney satisfaction increases → higher retention → more referrals → Second Chair's B2B growth

The compounding effect: honest B2C advertising doesn't just serve the claimant. It improves the entire system's economics — for the attorney, for Second Chair, and for the accident victim.

---

## Key Strategic Implications

1. **B2B CEP timing investment:** January-March is the highest-ROI window for B2B outreach. Attorneys are most open, conference season is approaching, and lead volume is low (which means the attorney is most anxious about their pipeline).

2. **B2C CEP timing investment:** The 72-hour post-accident window and the settlement-offer-receipt moment are the highest-ROI windows for B2C advertising. Both require timing-triggered digital advertising, not traditional brand advertising.

3. **The referral CEP for B2B is the conference floor.** PILMMA and state trial lawyer association events are where the most high-intent B2B CEPs cluster. Physical presence and peer endorsement outperform any digital channel.

4. **The social referral CEP for B2C is the most powerful and the least controllable.** Building advertising that creates vocabulary for peer-to-peer referral ("one call before you sign") enables this CEP without manufacturing it.

5. **The compounding system:** B2C and B2B advertising that aligns to each other's CEP calendars creates a flywheel — honest ads produce better-informed claimants, who become better leads, which create more satisfied attorneys, which creates more B2B word-of-mouth.

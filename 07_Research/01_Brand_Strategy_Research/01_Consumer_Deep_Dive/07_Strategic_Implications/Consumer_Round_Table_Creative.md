**Session:** 01 — Consumer Deep Dive (V10 Upgrade), Phase 4
**Participants:** John Hegarty (Chair), Ed McCabe, Graham Fink
**Contributing:** Julian Cole (strategy liaison)
**Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Translate consumer research and strategy decisions into creative territory; test creative ideas against the two consumer characters; produce creative briefs for both B2B and B2C

## Opening — John Hegarty

*"I've read everything. Eleven analyst documents, the round table decisions, the full character work on both the attorney and the accident victim. There's a lot of research here. There's also one very clear creative truth running through all of it. Today we make sure that truth becomes creative territory — not research summary. Let's start with what I find most interesting."*

## The Attorney as Creative Character — Hegarty's Opening Read

**John Hegarty:**
"The PI attorney is the most interesting character in the room, and no one in this category is treating them that way. They chose this career by accident. They fight billion-dollar insurance companies on behalf of people who have nothing. They're called ambulance chasers by a culture that doesn't understand what they do. They carry a stigma they didn't earn. And then — and this is the part that strikes me — they buy marketing services from companies that confirm everything people think is sleazy about their profession.

The attorney who cares about ethics is being systematically failed by their own marketing ecosystem. That's the creative wound. That's where our idea lives.

The B2B advertising that reaches this person is not a pitch for better leads. It's an acknowledgment: *we know what you're actually trying to do, and we're the first people in this category who won't make it harder to do it.*"

## The B2B Creative Territory

### Ed McCabe — Copy Direction

**Ed McCabe:**
"Let me test headlines against Hegarty's read.

The category says: 'exclusive leads,' 'highest conversion,' 'real-time delivery.'

We say something else. We say the thing that makes every other claim unnecessary.

Here are the options I'm working with:

**'Before you sign with us, call three of our clients.'** This is the anti-pitch. It turns the sales conversation inside out. Instead of claiming proof, we invite verification. The confidence implicit in this statement is more persuasive than any conversion rate we could print.

**'We'll show you the ad before you see the lead.'** This is the structural differentiator as a headline. Short enough to stick. Specific enough to mean something. Different enough to stop the scroll.

**'Cases that don't start with a lie.'** This one is stronger than it reads at first. It's not accusing competitors of lying — it's defining what we don't do. And for an attorney who's had to manage down client expectations created by misleading ads, 'doesn't start with a lie' is describing the dream, not making a claim."

**John Hegarty:**
"I want 'Cases that don't start with a lie.' That's the one. It's not comfortable. It's direct. It says something about the category without being defensive about it. And it speaks to the attorney who already knows what the category is like. Give them the phrase they've been thinking but couldn't say in their own advertising."

**Graham Fink:**
"If the headline is 'Cases that don't start with a lie,' the visual can't be polished. It has to look like the opposite of what the category looks like. I want a screenshot of an actual Second Chair ad — the real one, running right now — with the headline over it. Show the proof, don't describe the claim."

---

### Graham Fink — Visual Direction for B2B

**Graham Fink:**
"The visual brief for B2B is: show the real thing.

The category uses stock imagery of professional contexts — attorneys at desks, attorneys on phones. We don't. We use screenshots of our actual consumer advertising. We use data visualizations of real conversion data. We use photography of real PI attorney environments — the 900 square foot office in the professional suite, the solo who picks up his own calls.

The message the visuals deliver: Second Chair knows the real world of PI law. They're not performing professionalism — they're operating inside it.

One specific visual proposal: a split-screen showing what a competitor's B2C ad looks like (actual screenshot — 'new 2025 accident compensation program!', fake AI tool, actor testimonials) next to what Second Chair's B2C ad looks like (honest, specific, no false promises). This is 'show the real thing' applied as direct comparison. No copy needed. The visual argument is self-evident."

**John Hegarty:**
"That split-screen is the entire B2B pitch in one visual. But use real competitors' ads with care — we don't need to name them. The visual of 'what the category runs' vs. 'what we run' makes the point without litigation risk."

## The Accident Victim as Creative Character — Hegarty's Read

**John Hegarty:**
"The accident victim is a harder creative challenge than the attorney, for a specific reason: every other PI advertiser has already claimed their story. The 'you deserve to fight' story. The 'you deserve millions' story. The 'call us and we'll get you what's yours' story.

These stories have been told so many times, so loudly, that the accident victim's brain has learned to screen them out. The category has screamed itself into irrelevance.

So the creative question isn't 'how do we tell the accident victim story better.' It's 'how do we tell a story they haven't heard before, that makes them stop and recognize themselves in it.'

Here's the story they haven't heard: 'Before you decide, just find out what you have.' That's it. No promise of a windfall. No dramatic music. No scales of justice. Just one instruction, calmly delivered, by a person who looks like them.

In a category of circus noise, silence is the radical creative choice."

## The B2C Creative Territory

### John Hegarty — The B2C Idea

**John Hegarty:**
"The B2C creative idea is not a campaign idea. It's a brand idea that makes every execution possible.

The idea: **Honest PI advertising.** 

Not a tagline. A creative standard. Every piece of B2C creative is built on one question: 'What would honest PI advertising look like?' The answer drives every decision.

It would use real people, not actors. It would make specific, verifiable claims, not maximalist promises. It would acknowledge the accident victim's hesitation instead of ignoring it. It would give one instruction instead of five. It would be calm instead of urgent. It would show the decision moment instead of the victory moment.

That's the idea. Everything else is execution."

---

### Ed McCabe — B2C Copy Direction

**Ed McCabe:**
"The vocabulary brief from the consumer research is: 'find out,' 'before you decide,' 'what you have,' 'one call,' 'no commitment,' 'made whole,' 'fair.'

Avoid: 'sue,' 'claim,' 'fight,' 'deserve,' 'millions,' anything that activates 'I'm not that kind of person.'

The headlines I'm testing:

**'Before you say yes to anything, take 10 minutes.'** Clean. Specific. Minimum viable action. Doesn't assume they want to sue — assumes they want information.

**'I almost didn't call. I'm glad I did.'** First-person testimony compressed to two sentences. The 'almost didn't call' is the identity permission — if this person hesitated, it's normal to hesitate. The 'I'm glad I did' is the outcome without specifying the financial result. Let the viewer fill in the gap.

**'71% less. That's what people without attorneys receive on average.'** The honest statistic. Specific. Sourced. The most radical copy in the PI advertising category because it makes a verifiable claim instead of a promise.

**'Made whole.'** Two words. The entire emotional argument of honest PI advertising, compressed. Used as a headline, it arrests the accident victim who has been saying this phrase to themselves."

**John Hegarty:**
"'I almost didn't call. I'm glad I did.' — that's the campaign. That's the honest testimonial series. Real people. Real hesitation. Real outcome. Different each time. Same structure. The 'almost didn't call' does all the identity work. The 'I'm glad I did' does all the outcome work. Two sentences of copy that are worth more than any 30-second spot full of promises."

---

### Graham Fink — B2C Visual Direction

**Graham Fink:**
"The visual brief for B2C is the same principle as B2B but in a different register: show the real thing.

For B2C, the real thing is: a real person, in a real environment, at a real moment.

The signature visual I keep coming back to is: **a hand picking up a phone.** Not a dramatic full-body shot. Just the hand. The hesitation moment. The choice being made. It's not dramatic — it's specific. And it's the exact behavior we're trying to activate.

The anti-visual of the category: no scales of justice, no bandages, no hospital gowns, no waving money, no dramatic lighting. The visual language is documentary — the same aesthetic that makes a documentary feel more real than a movie.

**For the testimonial series (Hegarty's 'almost didn't call' idea):**
Each person is shot the same way. Natural light. Normal environment. Not performing. The imperfection is the authenticity signal. Perfect is ad. Imperfect is real.

The edit on each 30-second testimonial: 
- 0-5 seconds: The person, in their environment. They're looking at the camera. They haven't started talking yet.
- 5-20 seconds: Their hesitation story. 'I almost didn't call. I thought I was probably fine.'
- 20-27 seconds: The specific thing that changed. 'The initial offer didn't cover three months of physical therapy.'
- 27-30 seconds: 'I'm glad I made that call before I signed anything.' [Second Chair logo. One phone number. One URL.]

No music. No voice-over. Just the person."

**John Hegarty:**
"That's the ad. That's exactly it. The first 5 seconds of silence — just the person, looking at us — does more work than any amount of music or graphics. It says: this is a real person. Not a performance."

**Ed McCabe:**
"The closing frame is the most important frame. 'I'm glad I made that call before I signed anything.' The 'before I signed anything' is doing the behavioral work. It's a call to action embedded in a testimonial — the viewer who hasn't signed anything yet hears: you still have time."

## The Creative Debate: How Provocative Can We Go?

**Ed McCabe:**
"I want to test the limit. 'Cases that don't start with a lie' is provocative for B2B. Can we go there with B2C?"

**John Hegarty:**
"Not the same way. The B2B audience is sophisticated enough to understand category criticism and appreciate the candor. The B2C accident victim isn't processing the PI advertising landscape — they're processing their own situation. B2C provocation should be about the victim's situation, not about the category's behavior."

**Graham Fink:**
"There's one B2C execution that's provocation without accusation: a side-by-side. What the insurance company's adjuster told you vs. what actually happened. No names, no brands — just the pattern. 'They said: your claim will be resolved fairly and quickly. Here's what actually happened to 91% of quick-settlers.' That's category criticism from the victim's vantage point, not from ours."

**John Hegarty:**
"Yes. That works because it's education, not attack. The victim who sees it isn't watching Second Chair attack the insurance industry — they're watching Second Chair give them information they didn't have. The emotional response is not anger at the insurance company; it's recognition of their own situation."

**Ed McCabe:**
"The copy for that execution: 'They called first. Here's why.' Then the statistics. 'Adjusters contact you within 72 hours because they know the next 72 hours determine your outcome. Before you talk to theirs, talk to yours.' One number to call. 10 minutes. Free."

**John Hegarty:**
"'Before you talk to theirs, talk to yours.' — I want that. That's the line. It's direct without being aggressive. It assumes the victim already has an 'ours' — which they should. That's what Second Chair is providing."

## Hegarty's Final Brief to the Creative Team

**John Hegarty:**
"This is the brief. One sentence:

**Second Chair makes PI advertising honest — because both the attorney who runs it and the accident victim who sees it deserve better than what the category has given them.**

Everything else — the B2B campaign, the B2C campaign, the testimonial series, the visual system — is proof of that sentence.

When you sit down to execute, ask yourself: is this execution honest? Is it specific? Does it treat the person seeing it as someone intelligent? If yes, it's Second Chair. If it sounds like everything else in the category, it's not."

## 4Cs Consumer Questions — B2B: The PI Attorney

**Who is the consumer?**
The PI attorney is not a single character. They're four characters — the hungry solo (Tony Reyes), the established builder (Jennifer Walsh), the marketing director who isn't a lawyer (Marcus Chen), the tired king (Bill Taggart) — each requiring different timing, different language, and different proof.

But across all four: they are small business owners who chose an improbable career, carry a stigma they didn't earn, manage financial volatility they can't fully control, and desperately want the one thing the category has never given them: certainty.

**What do they want?**
They say they want quality leads. What they actually want is the Monday morning where they don't have to check the dashboard twelve times before noon. They want certainty in a profession built on contingency.

**What do they fear?**
Lumped together: wasting money, losing staff they can't replace, being invisible while competitors grow, and — beneath all of it — being abandoned by the pipeline at the worst possible moment. The solo practitioner's deepest fear is that the practice will fail and they'll have to go back to corporate law, admitting the dream didn't work.

**What does their decision process look like?**
Gut first. Social proof second. Risk evaluation third. Data fourth. Price fifth. Contract terms last. They claim to evaluate on ROI; they actually decide based on whether they trust the person across the table and whether a peer has vouched for the vendor.

**What is the CEP?**
Seven attorney CEPs documented (CONSUMER_CEP_MAP.md). The highest-value: the slow month (January-March seasonal), the referral drought (acute, unpredictable), and the post-trial recovery (reflective, strategic). Second Chair should be present in all three — but the slow month is the highest volume, and the post-trial is the highest quality (attorney is in the best emotional state to build a relationship).

**What do they aspire to?**
The faucet. A pipeline so reliable they can say no to a bad case because a good one is right behind it. Also: a million-dollar verdict, professional respect from peers, and enough stability to take a vacation without checking their phone.

## 4Cs Consumer Questions — B2C: The Accident Victim

**Who is the consumer?**
Mean age 40, 75% male, 74% employed prior to injury, 61% from low-to-middle income. They are working people who were doing something ordinary and are now dealing with something extraordinary. They are not litigants. They are people who want to be treated fairly by a system they don't understand.

**What do they want?**
They say they want to "get what they're owed." What they actually want is to be made whole — not in the legal sense, but in the human sense. They want the situation to be fair. They want someone to be on their side in a system that has no one on their side. They want to be the person they were before the accident happened.

**What do they fear?**
Being seen as "that person who sues." Making a big deal out of nothing. Being wrong about how bad it is. And — three months later — not having enough money to cover the bills.

**What does their decision process look like?**
Adjuster calls first. Adjuster sets the frame. Victim operates inside that frame unless something disrupts it — a friend's advice, a TikTok video, a search result, a second opinion. 68% never exit the adjuster's frame before signing. The disruption that works is: minimum viable action ("one call, before you sign, it's free, takes 10 minutes") that doesn't require identity-as-litigant.

**What is the CEP?**
Five claimant CEPs documented (CONSUMER_CEP_MAP.md). The highest-value: the 72-hour window (pre-adjuster, hardest to reach), the settlement offer moment (high intent, clearest action needed), and the social referral (highest trust, most conversion-ready). Second Chair's B2C advertising should be built around the 72-hour window and settlement offer moment — these are the two most consequential decision points.

**What do they aspire to?**
To get back to normal. Not millions — normal. The medical bills covered. The car fixed. The ability to go back to work without pain. The sense that what happened to them was acknowledged and corrected.

## The BECAUSE Insights — B2B

**Second Chair should position as certainty, not leads, BECAUSE:**
The attorney's deepest purchase motivation is not case volume — it's the relief of knowing tomorrow's pipeline is secure. Every behavior in the deprivation analysis (2 AM ceiling math, referral network scramble, accepting bad cases) is driven not by lack of cases but by anticipation of case absence. Certainty is what's actually for sale.

**Second Chair should lead with advertising transparency, BECAUSE:**
The community voice research (Session 02) shows that the top attorney objection to lead gen vendors is not price, not quality — it's opacity about advertising methods. Three named attorneys on the record demanded: "Show me what you're running on my behalf." Second Chair is the only vendor that can answer that demand. This is not a feature — it is the primary trust differentiator in the category.

**Second Chair should build through peer-to-peer referral, BECAUSE:**
63% of B2B purchasing decisions start with peer recommendations. For PI attorneys — a trust-deprived buyer in a category that has burned them repeatedly — this number is likely higher. No digital campaign competes with a respected peer saying "I've been using Second Chair for eight months and here's my actual conversion rate." The conference floor is the highest-value marketing channel.

**Second Chair's primary audience is the managing partner at small/mid-size firms (2-20 attorneys), BECAUSE:**
This segment represents the highest volume of potential accounts, the highest ROI sensitivity (they track their marketing closely enough to know when it works), and the highest conversion potential for a vendor that can prove its value in a short pilot. The mega-firm has its own lead gen machine; the solo can't afford to scale; the sweet spot is the firm that knows it needs to market but hasn't found a vendor it trusts.

## The BECAUSE Insights — B2C

**Second Chair's B2C advertising should lead with "find out before you decide," BECAUSE:**
The identity barrier ("I'm not the kind of person who sues") is the primary motivation barrier for accident victims. The "find out" framing doesn't require the victim to identify as a litigant — it only requires them to identify as someone who makes informed decisions. Every victim can be that person. Only some can be a plaintiff.

**Second Chair's B2C advertising should use loss framing, BECAUSE:**
Loss aversion is 2.5x more powerful than equivalent gain framing (Kahneman & Tversky). "Before you close this door forever, know what's on the other side" outperforms "you could get so much more." The settlement signature is irreversible — the most powerful behavioral lever available.

**Second Chair's B2C advertising should show ordinary people, not extraordinary outcomes, BECAUSE:**
The $10 million verdict is an aspiration cliché that the accident victim in Second Chair's target demographic cannot identify with. The regular person who "almost didn't call, but did, and found out the offer didn't cover my medical bills" is exactly them. Social proof from identifiable peers converts better than fantasy outcomes.

**Second Chair's B2C advertising should reach victims in the first 72 hours, BECAUSE:**
The insurance adjuster reaches them in the first 72 hours. If Second Chair's B2C advertising primes them — even via pre-accident brand awareness — before the adjuster calls, the adjuster's framing is no longer the only frame the victim has available. First frame wins; Second Chair needs to be in the frame before the adjuster arrives.

## The Connection Between B2B and B2C

The deepest strategic insight from mapping both consumer audiences simultaneously:

**Second Chair's B2B value proposition is strengthened by every improvement in B2C advertising quality.**

An attorney who runs Second Chair's leads — and Second Chair's advertising — gets:
- Clients who came through honest ads (no expectation mismatch)
- Clients who understand the process before they sign the retainer
- Clients whose settlement expectations were not inflated by "AI compensation calculator" promises
- Fewer problematic cases, fewer ethics complaints, higher client satisfaction

This is not a feature list. This is the attorney's professional life made better. Second Chair's B2C advertising quality is a B2B selling proposition that no other vendor can replicate.

The formula: **Honest B2C advertising → Better-informed claimants → Better attorney-client relationships → Higher attorney satisfaction with Second Chair → Better attorney retention → More B2B referrals.**

## Session-Level Summary — What This Consumer Research Means for Second Chair

The V10 Consumer Deep Dive has produced three fundamental upgrades over the original Session 01:

**1. The B2C consumer is now fully mapped.** We know who the accident victim is, what decision architecture they operate under, what they lose by not calling, and exactly when the advertising window opens and closes. B2C is no longer an aspiration — it's a researched strategy.

**2. The B2B consumer is now understood at the buying moment level.** The CEP map, the buying voice research, and the deprivation analysis together tell us not just who the attorney is but when they're ready to buy and what moves them at that moment. The research has moved from character knowledge to behavioral knowledge.

**3. The two consumer tracks compound each other.** Second Chair's strategic advantage is that honest B2C advertising is the B2B product — it is simultaneously what claimants need and what attorneys want. No competitor can replicate this because no competitor's advertising is honest enough to show.

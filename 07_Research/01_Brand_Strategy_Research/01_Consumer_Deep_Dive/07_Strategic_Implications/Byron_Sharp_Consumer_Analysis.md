## B2B Analysis: The Attorney as a Light Buyer

### The Fundamental Reality of B2B Mental Availability

Most PI attorneys are not actively shopping for lead gen vendors most of the time. They are occasional, infrequent purchasers of this category — entering it at specific moments (the CEPs documented in CONSUMER_CEP_MAP.md) and ignoring it the rest of the time.

This means that Second Chair's mental availability at the CEP moment is worth far more than any affinity or preference built between CEP moments. An attorney who "really likes what Second Chair stands for" but doesn't have Second Chair top-of-mind when they're in their slow January crisis will buy from whoever appears in that moment.

**The growth formula for B2B:** Be present and salient at the 7 attorney CEPs, with enough distinctive memory structures that Second Chair is the first brand retrieved when the attorney thinks "I need cases."

### What Second Chair Needs to Own Mentally

For mental availability to work, the brand must be linked to specific memory structures that are activated at the CEP. For Second Chair's B2B attorney audience, the memory structures that need to be built:

**CEP "slow month" mental availability:** When an attorney is anxious about case flow, the mental shortcut they need is: "Second Chair = cases without the ethical compromise." Not "Second Chair = a lead gen company." Every lead gen company is a lead gen company. Second Chair = the one whose advertising you can actually show your clients.

**CEP "post-bad-experience" mental availability:** When an attorney has just discovered their current vendor was running misleading ads, the mental shortcut is: "Second Chair = the one that shows you the advertising." This is not a position Second Chair has to explain — the attorney who arrives at Second Chair after a bad experience arrives with the question already in their mouth: "Can I see what ads you're running?" Second Chair's answer is yes.

**CEP "peer recommendation" mental availability:** The name "Second Chair" needs to be memorable and carry a clear association — not generic lead gen, but honest lead gen. When a peer mentions them at a conference, the name needs to land with an association, not as another generic vendor name.

### Distinctive Asset Recommendations — B2B

For Second Chair to build mental availability at B2B CEPs, it needs distinctive assets that are consistently used across all B2B touchpoints:

- **The "show the ad" proposition**: This is a structural distinctive asset — no other vendor in the category offers it. It should appear on every sales material, every conference touchpoint, every case study. "Here's what we're running on your behalf" is distinctive because no one else says it.
- **The transparency visual cue**: A visual representation of "showing the advertising" — whether that's a literal screenshot of an ad, a side-by-side of what claims were made vs. what the reality was — should become a recognizable Second Chair element.
- **The verification invitation**: "Before you sign anything, call one of our existing clients. Here are three names." This invitation — unique in the category — becomes a distinctive asset in sales conversations.

## B2C Analysis: The Accident Victim as a Light Buyer

### The Mental Availability Challenge for B2C

The accident victim is not just an infrequent buyer — they are a once-in-a-decade buyer (at most). The vast majority will only be in an MVA accident once in their lives as an adult claimant. This creates a profound mental availability problem: there is no way to build a "preference" for Second Chair's attorneys in the traditional sense, because the consumer didn't know they would need one.

The accident victim who doesn't already have a PI attorney in mind when the accident happens is — by definition — a light buyer who hasn't thought about this category. And because the accident happens unpredictably, the entire population of potential accident victims is in "pre-need" mode all the time.

This is why Byron Sharp's "reach light buyers" principle applies with unusual force to B2C PI advertising. The attorney who reaches accident victims through honest advertising before they need it (priming) and at the moment they need it (CEP timing) wins the category. Not the attorney who has built the deepest relationship with previous clients.

### The B2C CEP Timing Imperative

The mental availability problem for B2C is solvable through CEP timing:

**Pre-accident priming** (brand advertising): Creates the cognitive scaffold. The accident victim who has been exposed to the message "before you say yes to anything from an insurance company, make one call — it's free" has a mental shortcut available when the accident happens. The exposure doesn't need to be recent — it needs to be distinctive and memorable.

**72-hour window advertising** (performance advertising): Creates the behavioral trigger at the moment of entry. When someone searches "what to do after a car accident" or "do I need a lawyer for a car accident," Second Chair's attorneys appear with the message calibrated to that CEP ("before you talk to their adjuster, know what you have").

**Settlement offer timing** (performance advertising): When the specific behavioral signal is detectable (settlement-related searches, location-based triggers), the message shifts to loss framing ("before you close this door, know what's on the other side").

### The Distinctive Asset Problem for B2C PI Advertising

The B2C PI advertising category is visually and verbally saturated with category clichés: scales of justice, waving money, "we'll fight for you," "get what you deserve," billboards with a giant phone number. These clichés have eroded the distinctive asset value of everything they touch.

Second Chair's B2C distinctive asset opportunity: **honesty as a visual and verbal cue**.

An ad that shows a normal person, in normal clothes, in a normal setting, saying something factually true and specific ("the average car accident victim without an attorney receives 71% less in settlement") — with no scales of justice, no dramatic music, no implied windfall — is so different from category norms that it is inherently distinctive.

The "boring" honest ad is the interesting ad in a category that has maximized excitement and thereby destroyed credibility.

## The Mental Availability Connection Between B2B and B2C

The deepest insight from applying the mental availability framework to both audiences simultaneously:

**Second Chair's B2C brand advertising builds B2B mental availability.**

When PI attorneys see Second Chair's honest B2C advertising — the calm, factual, non-exploitative ads that treat accident victims with respect — they are experiencing the most powerful B2B sales argument Second Chair has. Not a deck. Not a pitch. The actual product. The advertising an attorney could show their clients without embarrassment.

This means that Second Chair's B2C advertising spend creates dual mental availability: it reaches accident victims at their CEPs AND it demonstrates to attorneys what honest lead gen advertising looks like.

A brand that builds mental availability on both sides of its market simultaneously with the same creative strategy is building an asymmetric advantage. This is Second Chair's opportunity.

**Framework:** Verbal identity; headline compression; vocabulary architecture

> *"Every great campaign begins with the right words. Not clever words. Not big words. The right words — the ones the audience uses when they're being honest with themselves, not when they're performing for the room. Those words, used precisely, are worth ten thousand headlines."*

## B2B Copy Architecture: Talking to the Attorney

### The Attorney's Actual Vocabulary

The research gives us the verbatim language of PI attorneys talking about lead gen. Not what they say in a focus group — what they say in a Fishbowl thread, in a LinkedIn post when they're angry, in a podcast interview when they're letting their guard down.

**The vocabulary of frustration (when they're burned):**
- "garbage leads"
- "all scams"
- "throw money into a black hole"
- "they don't even answer the phone"
- "worthless by the time I call"
- "I've been burned too many times"
- "race to the bottom"

**The vocabulary of hope (when they believe something might work):**
- "consistent source of cases"
- "something I can count on"
- "10 good cases a month"
- "actually injured, actually in my area, actually want to talk to me"

**The vocabulary of the purchase decision:**
- "I need to try something"
- "I don't want to get burned again"
- "proof from someone like me"
- "what do I do if it doesn't work"
- "who else uses them"

**The insight:** The hope vocabulary is embarrassingly simple. They're not asking for a revolution. They want cases that are real, from people who are injured, in their area, who answer the phone. The frustration vocabulary is specific and angry. The hope vocabulary is almost childlike in its simplicity.

**Copy principle 1:** Write to the hope, not the frustration. The attorney who is frustrated needs to be acknowledged, not sold to. But the copy that moves them is about the simple thing they're reaching for.

### The B2B Headline Territory

Testing these principles against the attorney research:

**Headlines that would land (B2B):**

*"Before you sign with us, call three of our current clients."*
This is the Ryan McKeen demand answered as a headline. It signals transparency, confidence, and peer verification — the three things burned attorneys trust most.

*"We'll show you the ad before you see the lead."*
Compressed version of Second Chair's differentiating position. The "before" is critical — it signals proactive transparency, not reactive disclosure.

*"Cases that don't start with a lie."*
This is the identity statement for an attorney who cares about how they get clients. It says "ambulance chaser" without saying it. It honors the wound. It speaks to Darl Champion and Ryan McKeen — the attorneys most likely to influence their peers.

*"What we run on your behalf. Before you ask."*
The "before you ask" is doing the work here. Every attorney has wanted to ask this question and been told they couldn't. The phrase signals a relationship inversion — Second Chair volunteers what others hide.

*"Certainty is the product. Leads are just how we deliver it."*
Steel's deprivation insight compressed to one sentence. This is the positioning statement as a headline. It sets Second Chair apart from every other vendor who sells leads. Second Chair sells certainty.

**The tone test for all B2B copy:**
Could Darl Champion read this without cringing? If the attorney who has publicly called the industry "a cesspool" reads our headline and nods — we're in the right territory. If he'd add it to his LinkedIn call-out thread, we've failed.

### The One-Word B2B Brief

From the culture analysis: the one-word brief for Second Chair's brand overall is **PROUD.**

For the B2B consumer application: the one-word brief for what the attorney should feel when they sign with Second Chair is **RELIEVED.**

Not excited. Not enthused. Relieved. The specific physiological experience of having found a vendor they don't have to be defended against. The feeling that this time might actually be different.

Every piece of B2B copy should produce that feeling in the reading.

## B2C Copy Architecture: Talking to the Accident Victim

### The Claimant's Actual Vocabulary

From the research (Reddit forums, advocacy sites, attorney consultation transcripts, CLAIMANT_PROFILE.md):

**The vocabulary of their situation:**
- "I just want to be fair about it"
- "I just want to be made whole"
- "I'm not looking to make a big deal out of it"
- "I don't want to be that person"
- "I'm probably fine"
- "The insurance company has been really helpful"
- "I just want this to be over"

**The vocabulary of awakening (when they realize the settlement was inadequate):**
- "I had no idea"
- "Nobody told me"
- "I thought that was what I was owed"
- "I wish I had known"
- "I almost didn't call"
- "I'm glad I found out before I signed"

**The vocabulary of the minimum viable action:**
- "I just wanted to find out what I had"
- "It costs nothing to find out, right?"
- "I wasn't ready to sue, I just wanted information"
- "My friend said I should at least call"

**The insight:** The accident victim has one consistent fear: being seen as "that person who sues." Every vocabulary choice in B2C advertising must be calibrated against this fear. Anything that activates the "lawsuit" association loses the audience. Anything that activates the "informed decision" association keeps them.

**Copy principle 2:** Never use the word "sue" in B2C advertising. Avoid "claim," "plaintiff," "settlement" in prominent positions. Use: "find out," "know what you have," "before you decide," "fair," "made whole."

### The B2C Headline Territory

**Headlines that would land (B2C):**

*"Before you say yes to anything, take 10 minutes."*
This is the minimum viable action instruction compressed. It doesn't ask them to sue. It doesn't ask them to hire a lawyer. It asks them to take 10 minutes before a decision that will be irreversible.

*"The first call is information, not commitment."*
Direct answer to the unstated fear: "If I call a lawyer, I'm committed to something." No — the first call is a conversation. No obligation. No cost. Just information.

*"71% less. That's what people without attorneys receive on average."*
The specific number. The research. The factual, verifiable claim that no PI ad has ever made because every PI ad is making maximalist promises, not honest statistics. The honest stat is so different it's inherently attention-arresting.

*"I wasn't trying to sue anyone. I just wanted to know what I was giving up."*
First-person, victim voice. The "wasn't trying to sue" directly neutralizes the identity barrier. The "wanted to know what I was giving up" is loss framing in the victim's own words.

*"They called me within 24 hours. I didn't even know that was normal."*
Showing the timing mismatch — the adjuster calls within 24 hours as a systematic strategy, and the victim doesn't know they're being worked. The headline is a revelation, not a promise.

*"Made whole."*
Two words. The moral intuition of the entire PI system, compressed. The copy that follows explains it. But the two words — "made whole" — are the emotional hook that accident victims will recognize as theirs.

### The One-Word B2C Brief

For the accident victim who calls through Second Chair's advertising, the one-word brief is **SEEN.**

Not rich. Not vindicated. Seen. The accident victim who feels seen — whose situation was acknowledged, whose hesitation was respected, who was given accurate information instead of a maximalist promise — is the accident victim who refers friends, who writes honest reviews, who becomes a social proof vector for Second Chair's attorneys.

Every piece of B2C copy should produce the feeling of being seen. Seen as a person with a real situation, not a target with an injury that can generate a fee.

## The Verbal Bridge Between B2B and B2C

The copy insight that connects both audiences: **Second Chair's brand language is the language of honesty in a category that speaks only in promises.**

For attorneys: "We'll show you the advertising before you see the lead."
For claimants: "Before you say yes to anything, know what you have."

Both sentences say: you have the right to information before you make a commitment. Both sentences demonstrate transparency rather than claiming it. Both sentences are the opposite of what every other actor in this category says.

**The brand voice is not loud. It is specific, specific, specific — and then quiet.** The category is full of noise. Second Chair speaks in evidence.

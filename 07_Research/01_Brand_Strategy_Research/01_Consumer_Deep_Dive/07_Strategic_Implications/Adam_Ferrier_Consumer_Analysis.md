## B2B Behavior Change Architecture: The Attorney Vendor Switch

### The Target Behavior

The behavior Second Chair needs to change: **PI attorney continues paying a bad lead gen vendor instead of switching to Second Chair.**

This is the master barrier — not "attorney isn't interested in lead gen" (they all are) but "attorney is inert with a suboptimal vendor." Understanding why the inertia exists is the behavior change brief.

### Motivation Analysis

**What is the attorney motivated to do?**
At the motivation layer: the attorney is highly motivated to get more and better cases. They know they're not happy with their current vendor. The motivation to change exists — but it's not sufficient to produce action.

**What undermines motivation for switching?**
- Risk aversion: "What if Second Chair is worse than what I have?"
- Decision fatigue: They've already made this decision before (badly) and don't want to make it again
- Identity preservation: The attorney who has been "burned before" may be protecting their identity as "someone who doesn't get fooled twice" — which paradoxically makes them resistant to trying again

**Motivation intervention:** Reduce the perceived risk of switching until the motivation-to-action ratio tips. The trial offer is a motivation intervention. The named reference from a peer is a motivation intervention. The transparent advertising review ("here's what we're running") is a motivation intervention. All of these reduce the perceived downside of changing behavior.

### Ability Analysis

**Can the attorney actually switch?**

Counterintuitively, the ability barrier for switching is significant:
- Finding and evaluating a new vendor takes time (scarce for managing partners)
- The transition involves admin: canceling contracts, setting up new platforms, training intake staff
- The attorney may not have the marketing knowledge to evaluate whether Second Chair is actually better
- "Ability" to evaluate quality is constrained by limited metrics (most PI attorneys don't track CPSC rigorously)

**Ability intervention:** Remove the transition friction. "We'll handle the setup. We'll provide the reporting. We'll show you the advertising — you don't need to evaluate it, you can see it." Second Chair's value proposition addresses the ability barrier directly: the transparency removes the need for sophisticated marketing knowledge to evaluate the vendor.

The minimum viable switch: "Try 10 leads. No contract. We'll show you the exact advertising we're running before you commit. If you don't sign a case from those 10 leads, you don't pay." This is such a low-ability-required action that almost any attorney can take it.

### Trigger Analysis

**What prompts the switching behavior?**

The documented triggers (from CONSUMER_CEP_MAP.md and ATTORNEY_BUYING_VOICE.md):
1. The slow month / seasonal anxiety spike (January-March)
2. The referral drought (acute, unpredictable)
3. The bad vendor experience (burning point)
4. The peer recommendation (conference floor)

**Trigger intervention:** Second Chair cannot manufacture the trigger — the slow month happens, the referral drought happens, the bad experience happens. What Second Chair can do is ensure it appears at all trigger moments:
- January Google Ads targeting "PI lead gen" and "buy PI leads"
- LinkedIn targeting law firm managing partners, PI specialty, during Q1
- Conference presence at PILMMA (the conference trigger)
- Content that appears when attorneys search for alternatives after a bad experience ("switch from [competitor]" keywords)

The behavioral design principle: Don't try to create motivation where there's none. Be present when the trigger already exists and the motivation is naturally high.

## B2C Behavior Change Architecture: The Claimant Legal Help Decision

### The Target Behavior

The behavior Second Chair needs to change: **Accident victim accepts first settlement offer without consulting a lawyer.**

The 68% who do this are not behaving irrationally — they are behaving according to the default behavioral architecture of the situation. To change the behavior, Second Chair must change the architecture.

### Motivation Analysis

**What is the accident victim motivated to do?**

The accident victim is motivated to:
- Resolve the situation quickly (closure drive)
- Avoid conflict or "making a big deal of it" (identity preservation)
- Feel financially secure (financial anxiety relief)
- Be treated fairly (fairness motivation — the strongest latent motivation)

The fairness motivation is the key. Every accident victim wants to be treated fairly. The gap between "what I was offered" and "what I was entitled to" — when it becomes visible — creates moral outrage. The behavior change opportunity is making that gap visible before the signature, not after.

**Motivation intervention:** Make the fairness gap concrete and specific before the settlement decision. "The average person without an attorney receives 71% less. On a typical soft tissue injury settlement, that's approximately $33,700 less. One call costs nothing and takes 10 minutes." This frames the decision in fairness terms (motivation layer) while providing a minimal action (ability layer).

### Ability Analysis

**Can the accident victim actually call a lawyer?**

The ability barriers are significant:
- **Cognitive overload**: In the 72-hour window, the victim is managing medical logistics, insurance calls, vehicle logistics, work absence, and family communication simultaneously. "Call a lawyer" is one more task.
- **Process ignorance**: Many victims don't know how to find a PI attorney, don't know that consultations are free, don't know what to say when they call, don't know that attorneys work on contingency.
- **Trust uncertainty**: "If I call, will they try to pressure me into hiring them? Will I owe them something? Will I have to go through a long process?"

**Ability intervention:** Reduce the complexity of the first action to its absolute minimum.
- "One call, 10 minutes, free, no commitment" — each of these words addresses a specific ability barrier (effort → "one call"; time → "10 minutes"; cost → "free"; obligation → "no commitment")
- A single, memorable phone number or text shortcode
- An explanation that the consultation is information, not commitment: "Find out what you have. Decide later."

The minimum viable action for the accident victim: **text a number** (lower friction than calling), receive information, decide whether to proceed. This is a smaller ask than "call a lawyer" and produces the same first-contact outcome.

### Trigger Analysis

**What triggers the behavior?**

The documented triggers (from CLAIMANT_DECISION_ARCHITECTURE.md):
1. The 72-hour window (adjuster's call creates implicit urgency)
2. The settlement offer arrival (explicit decision moment)
3. The social referral (friend's recommendation)
4. The medical bill arrival (financial reality check)

**Trigger intervention:**
- For the 72-hour window: Timing-targeted digital advertising (geo-triggered near accident locations, search-triggered by "what to do after car accident" queries). The ad must deliver the minimum viable action instruction within seconds.
- For the settlement offer moment: "Before you sign" messaging. Loss framing. Explicit warning about irreversibility. The trigger is the offer; Second Chair's job is to intercept before the signature.
- For the social referral: Create the vocabulary for peer referral through advertising ("before you sign anything, tell your friend to call first"). The social trigger happens organically — Second Chair enables it with memorable, shareable language.
- For the medical bill: "It may not be too late" messaging for victims who haven't yet signed. "Here's what to do if the settlement didn't cover your bills" for those who have (converts them into advocates and provides social proof content).

## The Unified Behavior Change System

The deepest insight from mapping both behavior change architectures simultaneously:

**The same behavioral design principle applies to both audiences: reduce the size of the ask until the barrier disappears.**

For the attorney: reduce the switching ask to "10 leads, no contract, see the advertising first."
For the accident victim: reduce the legal help ask to "one call, 10 minutes, free, no commitment."

Both are instances of Fogg's "tiny habits" principle applied to high-resistance behaviors: if you make the action small enough, the barriers dissolve.

And both produce the same downstream outcome: when the small action is taken, the larger behavior becomes possible. The attorney who tries 10 leads and signs 2 cases becomes a long-term client. The accident victim who makes one call and learns their offer was inadequate becomes a claimant who gets fair compensation.

**Second Chair's entire behavioral strategy — B2B and B2C — is about making the first action smaller than the barrier is tall.**

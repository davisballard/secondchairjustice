> *"I've been in more sales conversations than I can count. And the truth that nobody in strategy wants to hear is this: a great strategy that can't survive first contact with the prospect isn't a strategy. It's a wish. Let me tell you what works when you're actually in the room."*

## Reading the Four Attorney Buyer Profiles in the Sales Conversation

The attorney profile research identifies four distinct buyer types. Here's how each plays out in an actual sales conversation, and what closes each one:

### Tony Reyes — The Hungry Solo

**How to find him:** He answers his own phone. He'll respond to a well-crafted LinkedIn DM. He attends the local bar association happy hour.

**What his first 30 seconds tell you:** Whether he's in a "feast" or "famine" month. The hungry solo in famine mode will give you 20 minutes immediately. The same person in feast mode is hard to reach. Read the seasonal calendar — call in January, not July.

**The moment he opens:** When you say something specific about his market. "I saw you're running Google Ads targeting Phoenix MVAs. I wanted to talk about whether what we're doing might complement what you're already doing." He's been waiting for a vendor who did their homework. Almost none of them do.

**What moves him:** One story from one person who looks like him. Not a case study — a name and a phone number. "There's a solo in Scottsdale, Marco Sanchez, who started with us five months ago. Here's his number. Call him before you decide anything. He'll tell you exactly what happened." Tony will call Marco. If Marco says it works, Tony signs.

**What kills it:** Long contracts, minimums, opacity about how leads are generated. Say "month-to-month, cancel anytime" in the first two minutes. His defenses drop.

**The close for Tony:** Make the first commitment so small it would be embarrassing to say no. "Five leads. That's all I'm asking. See what happens with five leads. No contract, we'll replace any lead that doesn't meet our quality standard. Five leads."

### Jennifer Walsh — The Established Builder

**How to find her:** She's on LinkedIn posting about her trial wins. She's on the board of the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association. She goes to PILMMA.

**What her first 30 seconds tell you:** Whether she has a marketing director or she IS the marketing director. If she has a Marcus Chen, get to Marcus first. If she's the decision-maker, she'll tell you what her metrics are in the first five minutes. She's sophisticated. She'll mention her current CPSC.

**The moment she opens:** When you speak her language precisely. "I know you're tracking cost per signed case, not cost per lead. Here's our data on what CPSC looks like for firms like yours in the Atlanta market." The vendor who knows what CPSC is and leads with it earns five minutes of genuine attention.

**What moves her:** Scale with quality. She needs volume — 15-20 leads a month that her intake team can work. And she wants to know she can reach a real person when there's a problem. Not a ticket system. A human being who knows her account. "You'll have an account manager who knows your firm, knows your focus areas, and is reachable by text."

**What kills it:** Shared leads. If she discovers a lead is shared, she's gone and she'll tell everyone. Make exclusivity explicit and verifiable.

**The close for Jennifer:** The pilot program with clear terms. "30 days, 20 leads, all exclusive, Atlanta metro, focused on MVA with moderate-to-significant injury. I'll pull the reporting at 30 days and we'll look at it together. If the CPSC doesn't beat your current channels, we stop." She respects structure. Offer structure.

### Marcus Chen — The Marketing Director Who Isn't a Lawyer

**How to find him:** LinkedIn, marketing professional, law firm, Houston (or any major market). He's also at legal marketing conferences — not the PILMMA trial lawyer track but the marketing strategy track.

**What his first 30 seconds tell you:** He wants to know if you have a dashboard. Ask within the first two minutes: "Do you want to start with the reporting integration or the lead sourcing?" If he lights up at "reporting integration," you know what matters.

**The moment he opens:** When you speak data before anything else. "We can integrate with Litify. Here's what the attribution reporting looks like. Here's how you'd compare our cost-per-signed-case against your Google Ads performance in a single view."

**What moves him:** Compliance assurance. Marcus's career depends on not getting the firm in trouble. "Can you show me the exact advertising you're running? I need to be able to tell the managing partner that every lead we buy came through compliant advertising." Second Chair's "show the ad" position is designed for this conversation. It's the only position in the category that Marcus can verify.

**What kills it:** Vagueness about sourcing. If Marcus asks "where do these leads come from?" and the answer is "online," he's done. He needs specificity: the ad, the landing page, the intake process, the compliance review.

**The close for Marcus:** A pilot with clear measurement terms defined in advance. "Let's define success together. What CPSC beats your current Google Ads? What quality threshold do you need? We'll build the scorecard before the pilot starts." He needs to be able to show his managing partner a clean scorecard. Help him build it.

---

### Bill Taggart — The Tired King

**How to find him:** Don't call him directly. Get introduced through someone he respects — another managing partner at a similar-size firm, a Florida Justice Association contact. Cold outreach from a vendor reaches his assistant and stops there.

**What his first 30 seconds tell you:** That he's assessing you as a person, not your product. He's been in business for 33 years. He can smell desperation, and he can smell respect. Be deliberate. Be slow. Don't pitch in the first two minutes.

**The moment he opens:** When you demonstrate that you've done your research. "I've been watching your firm for a few months. I saw your verdict in the Hernandez trucking case. That's serious work." He lit up. Nobody has called to say that in a while.

**What moves him:** His marketing coordinator. Bill probably won't make this decision. His 26-year-old marketing coordinator will evaluate it and bring a recommendation. The way to close Bill is to close his coordinator so thoroughly that she is an internal advocate. Give her everything she needs to make the case internally: the dashboard, the reference calls, the compliance documentation, the CPSC comparison.

**The close for Bill:** The trusted peer introduction. "I'd like to introduce you to Michael Leizerman if you don't know him already. He's been working with a similar structure in Ohio and I think his experience would be interesting to you." If Leizerman vouches, Bill signs. That's the entire close.

## Using B2C Research in B2B Sales Conversations

The consumer research about accident victims is not just B2C strategy. It is B2B sales ammunition.

**The $33,700 gap as a B2B selling point:**
"The average accident victim without an attorney receives 71% less than those with an attorney. Our advertising tells claimants that before they make any decision. It's the only advertising in the PI lead gen category that does that. Which means the leads we send you are people who already understand why they need a lawyer — they're not going to be surprised by the process."

This lands differently than "we have quality leads." It is specific. It is about what the attorney's clients will experience before they even call. The attorney who has managed down inflated client expectations for years will immediately understand why this matters.

**The adjuster first-contact problem as a B2B selling point:**
"Insurance adjusters call within 72 hours. If we've reached the claimant before that call — or in the window before they sign — they arrive at your intake with a very different mindset than a client who was first contacted by GEICO. Our timing matters as much as our messaging."

This shows that Second Chair understands the attorney's client management reality, not just their marketing reality.

**The compliance angle as a B2B close:**
"Darl Champion's name is probably in your LinkedIn feed. He's been calling out lead gen companies publicly for running misleading ads. Every attorney who buys leads from those vendors is inheriting compliance risk. Second Chair's advertising is something you can review before you commit to using it. One less thing to worry about."

The word "worry" is the key. PI attorneys have more than enough to worry about. A vendor who removes a source of worry — rather than adding one — is immediately differentiated.

## What the B2C Research Tells Me About the B2B Sales Cadence

The B2C consumer research reveals something actionable for B2B sales timing:

**January-March is the window. This is when to sell.**

NHTSA data shows accident rates are lowest in winter. PI attorneys' case intake naturally slows. The attorney who is "fine" in October becomes anxious in January. The sales call that reaches them in late January — when the dashboard has been quiet for three weeks and they're starting to do the ceiling math — reaches a buyer whose motivation is at its peak.

The optimal B2B sales calendar:
- December: Content seeding. LinkedIn posts, emails that plant the Second Chair name without selling.
- January: The outreach. This is when to pick up the phone and call.
- February: The demo and pilot conversation. Attorney has been quiet for six weeks.
- March: The close. They've seen the first leads. They want to sign before spring surge.
- April-October: Retention and expansion. Spring and summer drive accident volume. The attorney who signed in March is now seeing the ROI.

That's the B2B sales playbook that the consumer research supports.

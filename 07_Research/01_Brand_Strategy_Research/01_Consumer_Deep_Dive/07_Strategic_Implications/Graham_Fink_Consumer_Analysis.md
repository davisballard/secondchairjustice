## B2B Visual Analysis: What Second Chair Should Look Like to PI Attorneys

### The Current B2B Visual Landscape

PI law firm marketing and legal B2B services share a visual monoculture documented in the Session 03 culture analysis (GRAHAM_FINK_CULTURE_ANALYSIS.md). For the B2B lead gen category specifically, the visual language is:

- **Photography:** Stock imagery of professional settings. Attorneys at desks, attorneys on phones, attorneys shaking hands. Occasionally: a stock photo of a car accident scene, intended to communicate "we understand your business."
- **Color:** Dark blue (trust, authority), gold/yellow (success, premium), white space. The occasional burgundy trying to feel distinctive.
- **Typography:** Sans-serif modernity (attempting tech company adjacency) or serif gravitas (attempting law firm adjacency). Neither particularly distinctive.
- **Visual metaphors:** Funnels (for leads), dashboards (for data), handshakes (for partnerships), arrows pointing upward (for growth).
- **Tone:** Corporate, confident, claims-heavy. Every visual says "we're a serious company." None say "we're different from every other serious company."

**The result:** A visual category so homogeneous that an attorney who sees Second Chair's marketing — if it looks like this — will not be able to distinguish it from six other vendors they've dismissed.

### The Visual Zag for B2B

The Session 03 cultural analysis established the principle: **show the real thing.** The visual language that earns attorney trust is not the visual language of abstract professionalism — it is the visual language of verifiable reality.

**For Second Chair B2B, this means:**

**1. Show the actual advertising.**
The most powerful B2B visual Second Chair can use is a screenshot of its actual consumer advertising. Not a design of what it might look like — the real ad, with real copy, real imagery, real claims. The attorney who sees Second Chair's actual consumer ad (honest, specific, non-exploitative) is seeing the B2B value proposition demonstrated, not described.

This is radical in the B2B visual landscape, where vendors use professional photography of business contexts. Second Chair should use screenshots of its own consumer-facing creative. Nothing demonstrates "we're different" more powerfully than showing the difference.

**2. Use real data visualization, not data illustration.**
The attorney audience trusts numbers over images. A visual that shows a real conversion dashboard — actual data points, actual percentages, actual CPSC figures from real attorney accounts (anonymized) — is more visually compelling to this audience than any designed infographic. The design principle: make the data the art.

**3. The photography rule: real people, real contexts.**
If photography is used in B2B materials, it should show recognizable PI attorney contexts — the 900 square foot office in a professional suite, the strip mall law firm, the solo who picks up his own calls — not the mahogany-office stock imagery that the category uses to signal prestige. The attorney who sees themselves in the photography feels recognized. The attorney who sees stock photography feels like a target.

**4. The color palette for trust:**
From the cultural analysis: the visual codes that signal trust to professional service buyers in 2026 are understated, specific, and evidence-based. Second Chair's palette should be simple — perhaps two colors, applied consistently. Navy and white is done; consider a clean forest green (health, money, life) with white. The color almost doesn't matter if it's used with sufficient consistency and discipline.

## B2C Visual Analysis: What Honest PI Advertising Looks Like

### The Current B2C Visual Landscape

The B2C PI advertising category is one of the most visually distinct categories in American advertising — and in the worst possible way. The conventions (documented in COMPETITOR_AD_AUDIT.md, Session 02):

- **Scales of justice:** Ubiquitous. Meaningless. The accident victim who sees scales of justice sees a category cliché that their brain has learned to ignore.
- **Dramatic lighting:** Atmospheric backlit silhouettes of determined attorneys. Dark backgrounds. Heroic angles. The visual language of action movies applied to law firm marketing.
- **Money imagery:** Literal dollar bills, settlement checks, numbers with many zeros. The visual promise of financial windfall.
- **Stock photos of "injured" people:** Neck braces, bandages, sad expressions, hospital gowns. The accident victim is visually reduced to their injury.
- **Phone numbers in enormous font:** The action item is so visually dominant that the entire ad is subordinated to it.
- **Actors playing clients:** The smiling "satisfied client" who received a payout. Always middle-aged, middle-class, with an expression of mild triumph.

**The visual message the category sends:** Injury = money. Come to us and you'll get money.

**The visual reality of the accident victim's experience:** Pain, confusion, medical appointments, bills, rehabilitation, the adjuster's friendly voice on the phone, a settlement offer that seems like a lot but isn't, a future of ongoing costs that the settlement won't cover.

The category shows the winning end state. The accident victim is living through the beginning.

### The Visual Zag for B2C

The visual zag for Second Chair's B2C advertising follows the same principle as the culture analysis: **show the real thing.**

**1. Real people, not actors.**
This is the primary visual distinction. The accident victim who sees a testimonial from an actor performing gratitude knows it's an actor. The accident victim who sees a testimonial from Maria Delgado, age 34, who says "I almost didn't call" in a slightly imperfect, unrehearsed way — recognizes a person. The imperfection is the authenticity signal. Perfect = ad. Imperfect = real.

**2. Normal environments.**
Not a dramatic backdrop. Not a hospital setting. The kitchen. The car (parked). The front porch. The environment of ordinary life where ordinary people are dealing with a situation they didn't plan for. The visual authenticity of the environment carries the credibility of the message.

**3. No injury iconography.**
No neck braces. No bandages. No sad-face hospital photography. The accident victim in Second Chair's advertising is not defined by their injury — they are a person who was injured. The visual treatment honors the whole person, not the condition. This is the visual version of McCabe's copy principle: don't reduce them to their circumstance.

**4. Documentary aesthetic.**
Soft, natural lighting. Handheld camera feel (or intentional approximation of it). Color treatment that suggests reality rather than production. This visual language — associated with documentary film, journalism, and authentic storytelling — signals credibility in a way that high-production advertising no longer does.

**5. The single image that says it all:**
If Second Chair's B2C advertising had a signature visual — the equivalent of a brand icon — it would be: **a phone being picked up.** Specifically, the moment before the call. The hesitation. The hand reaching. The choice being made. This image contains the entire behavior Second Chair is trying to change: the moment before someone decides to find out what they have. It's an action, not a condition. An agency moment, not a victim moment. And it's visually distinctive in a category full of injury iconography.

## The Visual System for Both Audiences

### The Unifying Principle

From the culture analysis: the unifying visual principle for Second Chair across both B2B and B2C is **SHOW THE REAL THING.**

- B2B: Show the actual advertising. Show the real data. Show real attorney contexts.
- B2C: Show real people. Show real environments. Show the real moment of decision.

This is a visual brand strategy, not just an advertising approach. Every visual touchpoint — website, sales materials, conference presence, social media, the product dashboard — should show real things, not designed approximations of real things.

### The Two-World Visual System

Second Chair operates in two worlds visually:
- **The professional world** (B2B attorney marketing): clean, data-forward, evidence-based, respected
- **The human world** (B2C claimant advertising): warm, real, documentary, specific

These visual worlds should feel related — same underlying commitment to showing the real thing — but should be distinct enough that the attorney recognizes B2B materials as professional and the accident victim recognizes B2C materials as human.

The visual bridge between them: **both use photography that looks like it was taken of something real, not staged.**

That visual commitment — real imagery in both worlds — is the identity thread that connects Second Chair's brand across its two audiences.

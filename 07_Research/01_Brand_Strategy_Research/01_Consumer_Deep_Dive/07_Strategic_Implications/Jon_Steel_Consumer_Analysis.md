## B2B: The Human Truth Under the Attorney Purchase Decision

### The Surface Story

The attorney says they want leads. They say they want quality, exclusivity, conversion rate, a reasonable cost per signed case. They'll talk to you about Google Ads CPC and intake conversion ratios and cost per signed case if you ask them. They have a rational vocabulary for this purchase.

But I've spent years in rooms with people who said they wanted milk, and what they actually wanted was their cereal not to be wrong. The stated desire is real but incomplete. The real thing is deeper.

### The Human Truth

I've now done the deprivation analysis for the PI attorney (ATTORNEY_DEPRIVATION_ANALYSIS.md) and the cultural analysis (JON_STEEL_CULTURE_ANALYSIS.md) and read every word of the attorney profile (PI_ATTORNEY_PROFILE.md) and the community voice research (ATTORNEY_COMMUNITY_VOICE.md, Session 02). Here is what I believe is true about the PI attorney's deepest purchase motivation:

**They are not buying leads. They are buying the right to stop worrying.**

The managing partner of a PI firm carries the practice's financial weight alone. Staff don't know how close the edge is. Spouses get the filtered version. Partners absorb the uncertainty silently. The attorney who is managing 80 active cases and still checking the intake dashboard twelve times before noon is not doing that because they need more cases right now. They're doing it because the silence of no new leads is existentially terrifying — not financially (today's finances are fine) but psychologically.

When leads flow consistently — when the Monday morning starts with three new inquiries — the attorney can exhale. They can make decisions from abundance, not scarcity. They can say no to the bad case because a good one is right behind it. They can pay Maria and mean it when they say the practice is solid.

That exhale. That specific physiological and psychological experience of not having to worry this week — that is what Second Chair actually sells.

**The narrative insight:** Every PI attorney has a Monday morning in their imagination where they don't have to check the dashboard. They don't need to call the Google Ads agency to ask what happened to the traffic. The cases are coming. The staff has purpose. The practice is alive. Second Chair sells that Monday morning.

### The Story to Tell in B2B Advertising

The B2B story that lands is not a product story. It's a character story. The character is the managing partner, alone with the fear, doing the math. And the story is the relief of that fear — not the elimination of it (PI law will always be precarious) but the specific relief of knowing the pipeline is full enough that this week, at least, they can exhale.

The moment to show is not the big case. It's the Tuesday afternoon when the intake specialist's calendar is full, when the paralegal is working cases not waiting for them, when the managing partner is prepping for a deposition instead of refreshing their CRM. The ordinary Tuesday that is only ordinary because Second Chair is doing its job.

## B2C: The Human Truth Under the Accident Victim's Decision

### The Surface Story

The accident victim says they want a fair settlement. They want their medical bills covered, their car fixed, the situation resolved. They'll talk about wanting compensation "for their injuries." The rational vocabulary exists.

But I've now done the deprivation analysis for the accident victim (CLAIMANT_DEPRIVATION_ANALYSIS.md) and studied the character in depth (CLAIMANT_PROFILE.md) and walked the entire decision architecture (CLAIMANT_DECISION_ARCHITECTURE.md). Here is what I believe is the real truth:

### The Human Truth

The accident victim doesn't want money. They want the situation to have not happened. Since that's impossible, they want the closest thing to it: **the experience of being treated as someone who matters.**

After an accident, everything in the victim's environment treats them as a number:
- The ER billing department processes their file
- The insurance adjuster works their claim
- The at-fault driver's insurance processes liability
- The rental car company rents them a car (if they can afford the deposit)
- Their employer notes the absence

Nobody in this system is working for them. Nobody has their interests as their actual job.

An attorney — a PI attorney on contingency — is the one entity in the entire system whose financial incentive is specifically aligned with the victim's best outcome. The attorney only gets paid if the victim is compensated well. Their interests, structurally, are the same.

But the victim doesn't experience it this way because PI advertising has spent decades performing advocacy rather than providing it. The actor on the TV ad who says "I'll fight for you" is performing a promise no one believes. The "consultation" that's really an aggressive pitch to sign a retainer immediately confirms the suspicion that attorneys are only in it for themselves.

**The deprivation insight, stated fully:** What the accident victim loses when they don't call a lawyer is not the $33,700 settlement gap. What they lose is the experience of having someone actually in their corner — working for them, specifically, by name — in a system that treats them as a file number. The money is the evidence of that advocacy. The advocacy itself is what they wanted.

**The human truth:** *The accident victim doesn't want to sue. They want to be seen.*

### The Story to Tell in B2C Advertising

The B2C story that lands is not the victory story. The $10 million verdict is aspirational noise. The story that lands is the one that makes the accident victim feel seen — that acknowledges what they're going through, that doesn't promise them what they haven't lost, that tells them the truth about what they have before asking them to do anything.

The voice is not the attorney's. It's the accident victim's: someone who "almost didn't call," who "wasn't looking for a windfall, just wanted to know what was fair," who "made one call before signing anything" and found out the offer didn't come close to covering what they'd need.

The moment to show is not the settlement check. It's the moment before the call — the hesitation — and then the moment of deciding that finding out what you have is different from "suing." The identity reframe as a lived experience, shown in a 30-second character study.

## The Connection Between Both Human Truths

The attorney truth and the claimant truth are not different truths. They're the same truth from different vantage points.

The PI attorney said this, and it runs through the entire PI_ATTORNEY_PROFILE.md: they chose this work because they wanted to be on the right side. They wanted to be the David vs. the insurance company Goliath. They wanted to be the person who makes a real difference at a real moment in a real person's life.

The accident victim wants the same thing from the other side: someone genuinely on their side. Someone whose incentives are aligned with their recovery, not with minimizing their payout.

Second Chair, in this framing, is not a lead gen company. It is the mechanism that connects the attorney who wants to fight for people with the person who needs someone fighting for them — honestly, without exploitation, without misleading advertising, without the ambulance-chasing clichés that shame both parties.

**The unified brand narrative:** Second Chair exists because the people who need help and the people who want to help them keep failing to find each other honestly. Second Chair fixes that.

This is the story that Second Chair's brand lives in. Not "we have better leads." Not "we're the ethical choice." The human story: **the right attorney and the right client, connected honestly.** That's the whole thing.

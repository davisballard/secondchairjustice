> *"When everyone zigs, you zag. The entire PI advertising category has been zigging for 30 years — promising millions, showing scales of justice, screaming into the camera. The zag isn't just different. The zag is honest. And in this category, honest is the most radical thing you can do."*

## The Creative Read on the PI Attorney Character

### What Makes the Attorney Interesting

I've read the attorney profile. All 600 lines of Jon's character work. And here's what I keep coming back to: the PI attorney is the most interesting character in the room, and nobody in advertising has noticed.

Every vendor talks to them as a buyer. As a business decision. As a target. Nobody has talked to them as a *person* — as someone who chose this career for real reasons, who carries a stigma they didn't earn, who fights billion-dollar insurance companies on behalf of people who had no one else fighting for them.

That story — the David vs. Goliath story that Jon documents as "bone-deep" in how attorneys think about their work — is almost never reflected back at them in B2B marketing. They get pitch decks about conversion rates. They should get an acknowledgment that what they do actually matters.

**The creative insight for B2B:** The attorney who feels seen — whose fighter identity is acknowledged, not exploited — is the attorney who leans forward. The B2B advertising that says "we build our products for attorneys who take their ethics seriously enough to care about where their leads come from" is speaking to the identity, not just the business.

### The "Zag" Test — B2B Category Conventions

Every other PI lead gen vendor says some version of:
- "Exclusive, high-quality MVA leads"
- "Real-time delivery"
- "Best conversion rates in the industry"
- "Boost your firm's revenue"

The zag is not saying any of these things.

The zag is: **"Here's the advertising we're running on your behalf. Before you sign anything."**

This is not a feature of the product. It is an identity statement about Second Chair. It says: we have nothing to hide. We're confident enough in how we get leads that we'll show you the exact ad before you commit. The vendor who says this is not selling a better version of what everyone else sells. They're selling something the category doesn't have: verifiability.

**The creative mandate:** Every piece of Second Chair B2B creative should contain the "show the ad" position — not as a feature bullet, but as evidence of a completely different way of operating. Show, don't tell. Lead with the actual ad creative. Let the honesty be the demonstration, not the claim.

### What the Attorney Character Demands of Creative

The PI attorney has been sold to and burned. They are specifically suspicious of:
- Big promises
- Claims that can't be verified
- Salespeople who don't understand PI law
- Anything that feels like every other pitch

They respond to:
- Specificity
- Peer voices
- Verification opportunities
- Calm confidence (the opposite of urgency sales tactics)

**The creative voice for B2B:** Not a vendor. A professional equal. Second Chair advertising should speak attorney-to-attorney — not in the sense of pretending to be a lawyer, but in the sense of understanding and respecting the profession. The copy that lands is the copy that could have been written by someone who has read PI law journals, knows what PILMMA is, and understands what "policy limits demand" means without explaining it.

## The Creative Read on the Accident Victim Character

### What Makes the Claimant Interesting

The accident victim is almost never treated as an interesting creative character. They're treated as a desperate person who needs to be told they're going to get millions. That treatment is both creatively lazy and strategically counterproductive.

Here's the real character: Someone who was living an ordinary life — driving to work, picking up groceries, taking the kids to school. And then in a fraction of a second, their life changed. They're now navigating a system that was not built for them, by people whose incentives are specifically opposed to their interests. They are, in the most literal sense, alone in a room where everyone else is on the other side.

That character — in genuine difficulty, not dramatized difficulty — is interesting. Their hesitation ("I don't want to be that person who sues") is interesting. Their minimization ("I'm probably fine") is interesting. Their moment of deciding to make one call — not to sue, just to find out — is interesting.

**The creative insight for B2C:** The accident victim's story is a story about having the courage to ask for help. Not the courage to fight. Not the courage to sue. The much smaller, much more relatable courage of saying: "Before I say yes to anything, let me find out what I actually have." That courage is universal. That moment is humanly interesting.

### The "Zag" Test — B2C Category Conventions

The PI advertising category for consumers is one of the most visually and verbally saturated in American advertising. The conventions:
- Scale of justice imagery
- Waving money (literally and figuratively)
- "We'll fight for you"
- "Get what you deserve"
- Dramatic music
- Phone numbers in enormous font
- Actors playing "satisfied clients" with implausible settlements

The zag: **None of that.**

The honest B2C ad looks like a documentary segment. Real person. Normal setting. Specific, verifiable numbers. Calm delivery. A single instruction at the end.

In a category of circus noise, silence is interesting. In a category of maximalist promises, a specific, restrained, verifiable claim is the most radical creative choice available. The ad that says "the average person without an attorney receives 71% less — it cost me nothing to find out" — in a normal voice, from a normal person, in a normal setting — is so different from category norms that it will stop the scroll.

**The creative mandate for B2C:** Make the ordinary extraordinary by showing it honestly. The accident victim's story is not a victory story. It is a survival story with a small, specific turning point: the moment they picked up the phone before signing anything.

### The Unexpected Creative Angles — Both Characters

**For the attorney:** Show the practice the lead gen keeps alive, not the lead. The Tuesday afternoon where the intake coordinator has a full schedule. The Wednesday where the attorney is prepping for a deposition instead of checking their dashboard. The absence of anxiety. That's the product.

**For the claimant:** Show the decision moment, not the outcome. The hesitation. The almost-didn't-call. The specific moment where they picked up the phone and said "I just want to know what I have before I decide." The outcome (the settlement gap) is almost secondary — the moment of choosing information over assumption is the human story.

**The thread connecting both characters:** The zag in both B2B and B2C advertising is the same. Every other vendor shows the big moment — the case settled, the revenue increased, the injury compensated. Second Chair shows the ordinary moment — the Tuesday where everything works because the pipeline is full, the phone call that takes 10 minutes and changes what comes next. **Second Chair advertising is about the small, human moment before the big outcome, not the big outcome itself.**

This is the brand's creative positioning: **honest, specific, human — because the category is fake, vague, and inhuman.**

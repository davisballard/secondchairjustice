# Color Weapons: High-Converting Hex Codes for Second Chair

Research on colors that trigger psychological responses—urgency, trust, money, action—for lead generation in the personal injury space.

---

## Why Color Matters for Second Chair

Personal injury lead gen sits at a unique intersection:
- **Victims are vulnerable** → Need trust signals (blues, greens)
- **Time-sensitive decisions** → Need urgency cues (reds, oranges)
- **Money/compensation is the goal** → Need wealth signals (golds, greens)
- **Must avoid "ambulance chaser" vibes** → Professional, not predatory

The right colors can lift conversions 20-40% in A/B tests. The wrong colors destroy trust in 50 milliseconds.

## The Research: What Actually Works

### Key Findings

| Study | Finding | Lift |
|-------|---------|------|
| HubSpot A/B Test | Red CTA beat green by 21% (due to contrast, not color alone) | +21% |
| Dmix Study | Red/orange-red buttons outperformed other colors | +34% |
| Forbes Lead Gen | Yellow→Red submit button change | +154% |
| VWO eCommerce | Red/gold/orange CTAs beat green in click rates | +20-34% |

### The Universal Truth

**Contrast matters more than the specific color.** A red button on a red page fails. A green button that pops against a neutral background wins. Always design for isolation—your CTA should be the only element in its color.

## Executive Summary

Text overlays and graphic elements can **dramatically improve ad performance** when used correctly:

| Finding | Data |
|---------|------|
| Text overlays increase CTR | +32% on Reddit, +46.9% on Meta (Agorapulse) |
| Text overlays lower CPC | -32% average (Agorapulse) |
| Site visits with overlay | +51% (Digible case study) |
| CTA button color matters | Green button = 3× more conversions vs gray (WordStream) |
| Button wording matters | "Show Me Outfits I'll Love" vs "Sign Up Now" = +123.9% lift |
| Text placement | Off-center text = +19-23% higher CTR than centered |
| Optimal text coverage | ~24% of frame = +127% CTR (sweet spot before decline) |

**But:** Too much text, poor placement, or low contrast **kills performance**. Keep under ~20% of image area for Meta delivery.

## Part 2: When to Use vs When Not to Use

### ✅ USE Overlays/Buttons When:

1. **Message must be instant** — User needs to understand offer in <1 second
2. **Urgency/deadline messaging** — "Time Running Out", "Deadline Approaching"
3. **Cold audiences** — They don't know you; need fast clarity
4. **Mobile-first placement** — Feeds scroll fast; overlay stops the scroll
5. **Testing value propositions** — Overlay makes A/B testing hooks easy
6. **Clear offer/discount** — "Free Consultation", "No Fee Unless You Win"

### ❌ AVOID or MINIMIZE When:

1. **Image is emotionally powerful** — Let the visual do the work
2. **Luxury/premium positioning** — Minimalism signals quality
3. **Google Shopping/Display** — Overlays often get disapproved
4. **Complex background** — Text becomes unreadable
5. **Already cluttered** — Adding more = visual noise
6. **Platform penalties** — Meta still throttles text-heavy images

### ⚠️ CONTEXT-DEPENDENT:

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Lo-fi authentic imagery** | Light overlay that feels "native" (like IG Stories text) |
| **High-production imagery** | Skip overlay or use very minimal branding |
| **Government form aesthetic** | Plain black text on white — overlay IS the look |
| **Video thumbnails** | Bold overlay helps — most scrollers see thumbnail first |

## Part 3: Second Chair Brand Color Integration

### Primary Colors for Overlays

| Element | Color | Hex | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----|-----------|
| **CTA Buttons** | Action Green | #22A659 | "Money/go" signal, high contrast |
| **Trust Headlines** | Trust Blue | #1E3A5F | Authority, professionalism |
| **Urgency Banners** | Alert Yellow | #F5A623 | Warning signal, deadline emphasis |
| **Deadline Text** | Urgent Red | #DC3545 | SPARINGLY — statute warnings only |
| **Background Strips** | Black | #1A1A1A | High contrast, authority |
| **Text on Dark** | White | #FFFFFF | Maximum readability |

### High-Contrast Combinations (Tested)

| Text | Background | Contrast | Status |
|------|------------|----------|--------|
| White (#FFFFFF) | Black (#1A1A1A) | 16.1:1 | ✓ AAA — Best |
| White (#FFFFFF) | Trust Blue (#1E3A5F) | 8.9:1 | ✓ AAA |
| White (#FFFFFF) | Action Green (#22A659) | 3.5:1 | ✓ Large text only |
| Black (#1A1A1A) | Alert Yellow (#F5A623) | 8.2:1 | ✓ AAA |

### Color Psychology for PI/Legal

| Color | Signal | Application |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Green** | Money, safety, "go ahead" | CTAs, positive outcomes |
| **Blue** | Trust, stability | Headers, trust elements |
| **Yellow** | Caution, warning | Deadline alerts |
| **Red** | Urgency, alarm | Statute deadlines ONLY |
| **Black** | Authority | Headlines |

## Part 4: Platform-Specific Rules

### Meta (Facebook/Instagram)

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **20% Text Rule** | No longer enforced, but still RECOMMENDED |
| **Text Coverage** | Under 20% = better reach, lower costs |
| **Categories** | Meta still classifies: Low, Medium, High text |
| **High Text Penalty** | Reduced reach, higher CPM |
| **Advantage+ Risk** | Auto-placement may add overlays poorly |

**Meta Best Practices:**
- Keep text under 20% of image area
- Bold, short headlines (3-5 words)
- High contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Avoid text over faces
- Test placement: bottom third often wins

### Google Display/Search

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Shopping Ads** | Overlays often DISAPPROVED |
| **Display Ads** | Minimal text preferred |
| **Image Extensions** | Text overlays may be rejected |
| **Logo Placement** | Separate asset, not baked in |

**Google Best Practices:**
- Clean visuals, minimal overlay
- Use ad copy fields for text
- If overlay needed: very small, subtle

### TikTok/Reels/Stories

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Native Text** | Use platform's text tools, not burned-in |
| **Safe Zones** | Keep text away from edges (UI covers) |
| **Caption Style** | Platform default > professional subtitles |

## Part 5: Split Testing Framework

### What to Test (Priority Order)

| Priority | Variable | Test Structure |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **P1** | Overlay vs No Overlay | Same image, with/without text |
| **P2** | Overlay Position | Top vs Bottom vs Center |
| **P3** | Text Amount | Headline only vs Headline + CTA |
| **P4** | Button Style | Baked-in button vs no button |
| **P5** | Color Treatment | Brand colors vs high-contrast |
| **P6** | Font Style | Bold sans-serif vs brand font |
| **P7** | Urgency Level | Neutral vs deadline vs scarcity |

### Test Structure Rules

1. **One variable at a time** — Isolate what moves the needle
2. **Same audience, budget, schedule** — Control for external factors
3. **Sufficient sample** — Minimum $100-150 per creative or 3,000+ impressions
4. **Duration** — 7-14 days for statistical significance
5. **Track beyond CTR** — CPC, CPL, conversion rate, quality

### Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|------------------|
| **CTR** | Does overlay grab attention? |
| **CPC** | Is overlay efficient? |
| **CPL/CPA** | Does overlay drive conversions? |
| **Reach** | Is Meta throttling for text? |
| **Frequency** | Creative fatigue? |
| **Relevance Score** | Quality perception? |

### Creative Fatigue

- **Refresh cycle**: Every 10-14 days
- **Signs**: CTR drops, frequency rises
- **Solution**: Rotate overlay styles, swap colors, new hooks

## Part 8: What NOT to Do

### Common Overlay Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Too much text** | Cluttered, gets throttled by Meta | 3-5 words max |

| **Centered on busy image** | Fights with visual | Bottom third or use background strip |
| **Generic CTA** | "Click Here" = low conversion | Specific action + benefit |
| **Fake UI elements** | Platform may reject | Design buttons to look like graphics, not UI |
| **Multiple CTAs** | Confusing, dilutes action | One primary CTA only |

### Platform-Specific Violations

| Platform | Common Issue | Risk |
|----------|--------------|------|
| **Meta** | >20% text coverage | Reduced reach |
| **Google** | Overlay on Shopping ads | Disapproval |

## Core Creative Strategy (From Alex)

### The Two Hypotheses We're Testing

**Hypothesis 1: Value-First**
> "By providing value more to the user, I suspect I will be able to increase conversion on the landing page by 10 percent."

**Hypothesis 2: Humor/Scroll-Stopping**
> "By creating something that's humorous and scroll-stopping but still has the same message as competitors, I will get more attention and convert more traffic."

### The 80/20 Split
- **80%:** Within the realm of what's proven to work
- **20%:** Novel, experimental, outside-the-box


---

## Pattern Interrupt: The First 3 Seconds

**This is the most important creative decision.**

Structure every ad:
1. **Pattern interrupt** (first 3 seconds) — something that stops the scroll
2. **Call out the avatar** — be explicit about who this is for
3. **Deliver the message** — value prop, hook, CTA

**Example structure:**
> [Crazy visual/statement] → "If you're a California driver who's been injured in an accident..." → [Rest of ad]

---

## NEW: The "Accident Advocate" Angle

**Core Positioning:**
> "Become an advocate for the victim and give them free tools while still capturing their lead information."

**Differentiation:**
> "We are the only service... the only accident advocates that generate and provide tools to help you empower yourself."

**Messaging Direction:**
- "Get the least stress and the most upside"
- "We found that those who go prepared see better outcomes"
- "Use our free case builder tool"

**Creative Execution:**
- Lead with value, not ask
- Demonstrate tools in ad creative (screen recordings of landing page)
- Position as helper, not salesperson

---

## NEW: Industry Trope Subversion

**The Opportunity:**
> "There's even some white space where they don't use gavels... old bound books and like marble staircase... I know I could find a good way to play off that trope."

**Tired Industry Tropes:**
- Gavels
- Leather-bound books
- Marble staircases
- Men in suits looking serious
- Generic stock photo families

**Subversion Approaches:**
- Satirize the tropes directly
- Go aggressively modern/anti-corporate
- Use humor to call out the clichés
- Create visuals that look nothing like law firm ads

---

## NEW: Humor & Outlandish Content

High CTR formats proven in testing:
- **Bigfoot ad** — pattern interrupt with absurdist humor
- **Shaking video** — motion-based attention grab (900% above average CTR)
- **AI avatars** — with unexpected/humorous scripts

**Guidelines:**
- Call out avatar clearly despite the humor
- Never mislead about what you're offering
- Humor is the hook, value is the message
- Can be as outlandish as you want AFTER calling out avatar

---

## NEW: Insurance Company as Villain

**Creative Angle:**
> "The villain was obviously the insurance company that's like something we can kind of talk about."

**Execution:**
- Position insurance as the antagonist
- Create us-vs-them dynamic
- Frame attorneys as the equalizer
- Must run through compliance engine (@Saul)

**Compliance Warning:**
This angle requires careful review. Cannot make false claims about insurance companies specifically.

## Behavioral Science Angle Framework

### The Hierarchy of Persuasion

Every angle should activate at least one of these psychological mechanisms (ranked by effectiveness in PI advertising):

| Rank | Mechanism | Trigger | Example Hook |
|------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | **Loss Aversion** | Fear of losing rights/money | "Don't let the deadline cost you..." |
| 2 | **Self-Reference** | Personal relevance | "If this happened to you in [City]..." |
| 3 | **Authority Contrast** | David vs Goliath framing | "They have billion-dollar lawyers..." |
| 4 | **Temporal Urgency** | Deadline/statute framing | "The clock is ticking on your claim..." |
| 5 | **Moral Outrage** | Fairness violation | "Insurance companies count on you not knowing..." |
| 6 | **Social Proof** | Others in same situation | "Thousands have already..." |

---

## NEW: Behaviorally-Optimized Angles (P1 Priority)

### The "Counterfactual" Angle

**Core Psychology:** Regret aversion + loss framing. People are more motivated to avoid future regret than to gain future benefits.

**Visual Direction:** Before/after comparisons, split-screen showing two paths

**Hook Examples:**
- "5 years from now, will you wish you had called?"
- "The people who didn't call back then..."
- "Two accident victims. Same crash. Different outcomes. Here's why..."

**Copy Direction:**
> Headline: "Don't Become the Story of 'I Wish I Had Called'"
> Body: "Most people don't realize the statute of limitations until it's too late..."

---

### The "Insider Exposé" Angle

**Core Psychology:** Information asymmetry + conspiracy framing. Creates us-vs-them dynamic where the viewer feels they're getting privileged information.

**Visual Direction:** "Leaked document" aesthetics, green screen over industry documents

**Hook Examples:**
- "The internal memo insurance adjusters don't want you to see..."
- "I'm going to show you exactly what they're trained to say..."
- "This is the playbook they use against you..."

**Copy Direction:**
> Headline: "The Adjuster's Playbook They Don't Want You to See"
> Body: "This is exactly how they're trained to minimize claims..."

---

### The "Pattern Recognition" Angle

**Core Psychology:** Self-referencing effect. When people recognize their own situation, engagement spikes dramatically.

**Visual Direction:** Situational imagery that matches viewer context (time of day, location, weather)

**Hook Examples:**
- "If you drive [specific highway] in [City]..."
- "Recognize this intersection?"
- "If this sounds like your morning commute..."

**Copy Direction:**
> Headline: "[Highway 101] Has the Highest Accident Rate in [County]. Here's What Victims Need to Know."
> Body: "If you've been in an accident on [Highway], you're not alone..."

---

### The "Asymmetric Knowledge" Angle

**Core Psychology:** Competence signaling + insider knowledge. Demonstrates expertise through revelation, not claim.

**Visual Direction:** War room aesthetics, behind-the-scenes legal work, document close-ups

**Hook Examples:**
- "3 things your own insurance company hopes you never discover..."
- "The black box in your car is recording everything. Do you know how to use it?"
- "There's a document you can request that changes everything..."

**Copy Direction:**
> Headline: "The Document Insurance Companies Pray You Never Request"
> Body: "It's called [specific document] and it could be worth thousands..."

---

### The "Moral Inversion" Angle

**Core Psychology:** Haidt's Moral Foundations theory — fairness and harm are universal triggers. Frame the insurance company as the immoral actor.

**Visual Direction:** David vs Goliath metaphors, corporate coldness vs human warmth

**Hook Examples:**
- "They have billion-dollar legal teams. Shouldn't you have someone too?"
- "Their job is to pay you less. Our job is to make sure they don't."
- "Insurance made $50 billion last year. They can afford to pay your claim."

**Copy Direction:**
> Headline: "They Profit When You Accept Less. We Don't."
> Body: "Insurance companies have entire departments dedicated to minimizing your claim..."

---

### The "Temporal Pressure" Angle

**Core Psychology:** Scarcity + loss aversion applied to time. Creates urgency without false deadlines.

**Visual Direction:** Clock/calendar imagery, countdown aesthetics, "window closing" metaphors

**Hook Examples:**
- "In [State], you have [X] years. But evidence disappears in [X] days."
- "The statute of limitations isn't your real deadline. This is..."
- "Every day you wait, your case gets harder to prove. Here's why..."

**Copy Direction:**
> Headline: "Your Legal Deadline and Your Evidence Deadline Are Not the Same"
> Body: "Security footage gets deleted in 30 days. Witness memories fade. Black box data gets overwritten..."

---

## Proven Angle Categories

### 1. The "Insider Secret" Angle

**Core Idea:** Position attorney as insider revealing what the other side doesn't want you to know.

**Why It Works:** Creates information asymmetry. User feels they're getting privileged access.

**Hook Examples:**
- "Insurance companies don't want you to know this..."
- "I'm a lawyer and I would NEVER..."
- "Here's what adjusters are trained to do..."

**Copy Direction:**
> Headline: "3 Things Insurance Adjusters Hope You Never Find Out"
> Body: "Here's how the game is really played behind the scenes..."

**Visual Direction:**
- Green Screen over insurance company documents
- "Leaked" memo aesthetic
- Car rant format (confidential vibe)

---

### 2. The "Myth Buster" Angle

**Core Idea:** Identify common misconceptions and correct them with authority.

**Why It Works:** Challenges assumed knowledge. User wants to know the truth.

**Hook Examples:**
- "Everyone thinks [X]. Wrong."
- "Stop believing this myth about [situation]..."
- "This is FALSE and it's costing you money..."

**Copy Direction:**
> Headline: "Think Rear-End Crashes Are Always Your Fault? Think Again."
> Body: "In [State], if the front driver brake-checked you, they could be liable..."

**Visual Direction:**
- Dual creator format (wrong vs right)
- Text overlay with "MYTH" crossed out
- Before/After knowledge

---

### 3. The "Urgent Alert" Angle

**Core Idea:** Frame message as time-sensitive warning or public health alert.

**Why It Works:** Bypasses "I don't need a lawyer" filter. User engages because of concern for safety/health.

**Hook Examples:**
- "Warning: [Product] users in [State]..."
- "If you used [Product] between [Years], read this now..."
- "Deadline approaching for [Situation] victims..."

**Copy Direction:**
> Headline: "Warning: If You Used [Product] and Developed [Condition], A Federal Settlement Fund May Compensate You."
> Body: "New studies have linked..."

**Visual Direction:**
- Government form aesthetic
- News alert style
- Yellow/black warning imagery

**Compliance Note:** Ensure "Federal Trust Fund" or similar claims are accurate to specific tort. Run by @Saul.

---

### 4. The "You're Not Alone" Angle ⏸️ P3 PRIORITY

> **Status:** Deprioritized until creator partnerships active. Keep for future reference.

**Core Idea:** Normalize the situation. Others have been through this. Help is available.

**Why It Works:** Reduces isolation and shame. Accident victims often feel alone.

**Current Limitation:** Specific numbers ("500+ families helped") and testimonial-style visuals require real client data and creator content we don't currently have access to.

**Hook Examples (Modified for Current Use):**
- ~~"Thousands of [City] residents have been through exactly this..."~~ → "This happens more often than you think in [City]..."
- "You're not the first person insurance tried to lowball..."
- "If this sounds familiar, you're not alone..."

**Copy Direction (Current):**
> Headline: "Accident Victims in [City] Face This Every Day"
> Body: "When [situation] happens, you don't have to figure it out alone..."

**Copy Direction (Future — When Real Data Available):**
> Headline: "Last Year, We Helped 500+ [City] Families Just Like Yours"
> Body: "When [situation] happens, you don't have to figure it out alone..."

**Visual Direction:**
- ~~Client comfort photography~~ → AI-generated supportive imagery
- Community/local imagery (AI-generatable)
- ~~Testimonial style~~ → Future priority when creators available

---

### 5. The "Protector" Angle

**Core Idea:** Position firm as guardian/shield against intimidating opposition.

**Why It Works:** Insurance companies feel like Goliath. User wants David on their side.

**Hook Examples:**
- "They have teams of lawyers. Shouldn't you?"
- "Level the playing field..."
- "Someone in your corner..."

**Copy Direction:**
> Headline: "Insurance Companies Have Billion-Dollar Legal Teams. Now You Have One Too."
> Body: "We handle the fight so you can focus on healing..."

**Visual Direction:**
- War room imagery
- David vs Goliath visual metaphor
- Shield/protection symbolism

---

## By Injury Type

**Proven Angles:**
- The "Don't Admit Fault" warning
- The "Black Box Data" insider tip

- The "Delayed Injury" awareness (symptoms appearing later)

**Specific Hooks:**
> "The first thing insurance asks at the scene? They're hoping you say this..."
> "I've seen $50K cases turn into $500K cases because of one document..."
> "Your back might feel fine today. In 2 weeks, you'll wish you'd done this..."

---

### Motorcycle Accidents

**Proven Angles:**
- The "Rider Bias" awareness (other drivers don't look for bikes)
- The "Serious Injury" reality (motorcycle accidents = higher severity)
- The "Lane Splitting" education (where legal)

**Specific Hooks:**
> "Drivers never see us coming. When they hit you, here's what you do..."
> "Motorcycle accident injuries are more serious. Your case might be worth more than you think..."
> "They'll blame the rider. Don't let them. Here's how to fight back..."

---

### Truck/Semi Accidents

**Proven Angles:**
- The "Multiple Parties" revelation (driver, company, manufacturer all liable)
- The "Black Box" data capture urgency
- The "Corporate Legal Team" asymmetry

**Specific Hooks:**
> "The trucking company has lawyers. Do you?"
> "An 18-wheeler hit you. The driver's company has billion-dollar coverage..."
> "There's a black box in that truck that recorded everything. It gets erased in 30 days..."

---

### Rideshare Accidents (Uber/Lyft)

**Proven Angles:**
- The "Who's Responsible?" confusion resolution
- The "Insurance Maze" navigation
- The "You're Covered" reassurance

**Specific Hooks:**
> "Hit by an Uber? Here's who actually pays..."
> "Rideshare accidents have 3 insurance policies. Most people only know about 1..."
> "Injured in a Lyft? Don't let them shuffle you around..."

---

## Out of Scope Angles

## For @Executive_Creative_Director

### Creative Development Process

1. **Start with insight:** What truth about the audience?
2. **Find tension:** What conflict or problem?
3. **Create hook:** What's the one-line capture?
4. **Develop proof:** How do we support this?
5. **Check compliance:** Run by @Saul before production
6. **Produce lo-fi first:** Test before investing in production
7. **Scale or kill:** Data-driven decisions within 7 days

### Stop Looking at Law Firm Ads

**Key Insight from Research:**
> "Stop looking at other law firm ads. Look at what top creators are doing in OTHER niches and adapt those formats to law."

Study:
- Finance TikTok
- Real estate content creators
- Health/wellness educators
- News commentary formats

Adapt their hooks, formats, and styles to legal.

### Geo-Targeted "Starter Pack" Imagery

For maximum scroll-stopping power, pair these hooks with hyper-specific regional identity imagery.

**See:** `Starter_Pack_Framework.md`

The "Starter Pack" approach uses behavioral science (identity salience, localized norms) to create visuals that make people stop because they see *themselves*—their exact archetype, in their exact location, wearing exactly what they wear.

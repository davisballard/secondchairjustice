# Alex DuBelko vs. Danny Dilworth: Head-to-Head Comparison

**Date:** February 20, 2026  
**Purpose:** Objective capability comparison for the "product person" seat at Second Chair  
**Verdict:** Alex DuBelko is the superior fit by a significant margin

---

## Overall Assessment

**Alex DuBelko is approximately 214% better suited for Second Chair's product role than Danny Dilworth.**

That number comes from scoring both across the 12 capabilities that matter most for Second Chair's success (see Section IV). Alex wins all 12 categories. Not 10 out of 12 — all 12. Even design, which was supposed to be Danny's one advantage, goes to Alex based on actual output quality (Davis has seen both firsthand).

The short version: Danny is a designer who calls himself a product person. Alex is an actual product person who can also design, code, model financials, and build with AI. Danny makes things look good. Alex makes things work, grow, and make money.

## I. Where Alex Wins (10 of 12)

### 1. Can He Actually Code?

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **Full-stack development** | No | Yes — General Assembly immersive (Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS) |
| **Can build a website from scratch** | No (designs it, needs a developer) | Yes |
| **Can build internal tools** | No | Yes — recently built a proprietary trading platform with AI agents (Claude Code) |
| **Can build and ship an MVP** | Needs to hire a dev | Can do it himself in days |

**Why it matters for Second Chair:** The product person needs to BUILD the website, funnels, tools, and CRM integrations. Not design them in Figma and hand them off. Alex ships. Danny specs.

**Edge: Alex (+100%)**

---

### 2. Product Management Methodology

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **Formal PM training** | None | Reforge 4x alum (Product Strategy, Scaling Product Delivery, Growth Series, Mastering PM) |
| **0-to-1 product builds** | CaseSnapshot, GetMyVisa (small tools) | TradeStation mobile app (0-1, FINRA-compliant, 99.96% crash-free, 60% app store rating increase) |
| **Product lifecycle ownership** | Design phase only | Full lifecycle: discovery → ideation → scoping → build → ship → iterate with data |
| **Roadmap & stakeholder management** | Not demonstrated | Multi-year roadmap execution, executive alignment, cross-functional team leadership |

**Why it matters:** Second Chair needs someone who can own the product roadmap end-to-end — not just make wireframes. Alex has built and shipped regulated financial products at scale. Danny designed screens.

**Edge: Alex (+90%)**

---

### 3. Growth & Conversion Optimization

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **Growth training** | None formal | CXL certified (Conversion Optimization, Growth Marketing, Data Analytics, Digital Psychology) + Reforge Growth Series |
| **Funnel optimization** | Designed flows (UX) | Designed AND optimized flows with data — slashed time-to-first-trade at TradeStation, boosted funded-to-1st-trade conversion |
| **A/B testing at scale** | Mentions it as a skill | Systematic infrastructure: product tours, contextual nudges, habit-forming journey design |
| **Lead scoring/routing** | Not demonstrated | Built lead scoring system at Alfred Realty (67% MQL-to-SQL lift, 13% faster speed-to-lead) |

**Why it matters:** Second Chair's funnels and quiz flows ARE the product. The person optimizing them needs growth methodology, not just design instinct. Alex has the formal training AND the results.

**Edge: Alex (+85%)**

---

### 4. Financial Modeling & Business Acumen

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **Financial modeling** | Not demonstrated | Private equity analyst at Breakwater Management ($550M+ fund). Built DCF models, sensitivity analyses, transaction models for 8+ acquisitions |
| **ROI/unit economics** | Wanted to sell leads at $300 (industry standard, no differentiation) | Can build ROI calculators, scenario models, and financial packages that justify $400/lead |
| **Investor-ready materials** | Not demonstrated | Created IC memos, pitch decks, and executive summaries that drove approval decisions |
| **Business finance education** | Not listed | BA Psychology + Business Finance, Financial Risk Management, Derivatives, Macro/Micro Economics coursework |

**Why it matters:** Second Chair needs to build case value estimators, ROI calculators for attorney prospects, and financial models for growth planning. Danny has no financial modeling background. Alex lived it at Breakwater.

**Edge: Alex (+95%)**

---

### 5. CRM & MarTech Architecture

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **CRM expertise** | HubSpot certification (expired March 2025) | Built entire MarTech stack at Alfred Realty — CRM, analytics, forms, enrichment, lead routing, scoring rules, event taxonomy, source-of-truth dashboard |
| **Lead lifecycle design** | Not demonstrated | Owned full lifecycle: source → qualify → NDA/OM → tour/underwrite → IC/LOI → PSA/escrow → close |
| **Automation** | Not demonstrated | Sales automation, drip sequences, automated follow-up cadences |

**Why it matters:** Sasha needs a CRM to sell through. Alex has built one from scratch. Danny has an expired HubSpot cert.

**Edge: Alex (+90%)**

---

### 6. AI-Powered Tool Building

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **AI development** | Not demonstrated | Built a proprietary trading platform using a team of AI agents with Claude Code |
| **AI workflow integration** | Not demonstrated | Currently integrating AI workflows at Carsey-Werner for content operations automation |
| **Rapid prototyping with AI** | Not demonstrated | Demonstrated ability to build functional products with AI assistance in compressed timelines |

**Why it matters:** The future of Second Chair includes AI-powered intake optimization, smart form logic, automated lead qualification, and data enrichment. Alex is already building with AI agents. Danny has never mentioned AI development.

**Edge: Alex (+100%)**

---

### 7. Data & Analytics Infrastructure

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **Custom dashboards** | Not demonstrated | Built real estate analytics dashboard at Compass using APIs (MLS, Zillow, Redfin) with statistical modeling, pricing forecasts, and appreciation heatmaps |
| **Data pipeline design** | Not demonstrated | Event tracking, KPI definition, attribution modeling (CXL training) |
| **API integrations** | Not demonstrated | Demonstrated across Compass (MLS/Zillow/Redfin APIs) and Carsey-Werner (metadata/rights systems) |

**Why it matters:** Second Chair needs lead quality dashboards, DMA performance tracking, and partner reporting. Alex has built exactly this kind of infrastructure. Danny has not.

**Edge: Alex (+95%)**

---

### 8. Regulatory Compliance in Product

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **Regulated product experience** | Legal lead gen (Lead Faucet) | FINRA/SEC compliance at TradeStation (100% regulatory compliance on mobile app), California real estate law at Compass, content licensing at Carsey-Werner |
| **Depth of compliance work** | State bar rules, TCPA | Financial regulations (7 Tier-1 authorities), real estate disclosure law, IP/copyright protection |

**Why it matters:** Legal lead gen is heavily regulated. Alex has navigated FINRA/SEC — arguably the strictest regulatory environment in tech. State bar advertising rules are tame by comparison.

**Edge: Alex (+60%)**

---

### 9. Mobile Product Experience

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **Mobile app leadership** | Not demonstrated as PM | Led iOS & Android teams at TradeStation — 0-to-1 build, 99.96% crash-free sessions, 60% app store rating increase, 32% complaint reduction |
| **Mobile-first thinking** | Designs mobile UX | Builds, ships, and optimizes mobile products at scale |

**Why it matters:** Most leads come through mobile. The person building Second Chair's funnels needs to think mobile-first from an engineering and optimization perspective, not just a design one.

**Edge: Alex (+80%)**

---

### 10. Sales & Business Development Experience

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **Sales experience** | Not demonstrated | ChowNow (Sales Associate → Senior SDR), 300+ discovery meetings with asset managers/family offices at Alfred Realty |
| **Understanding buyer psychology** | From design perspective | From sales floor + financial underwriting + PE deal evaluation perspective |

**Why it matters:** Alex understands how buyers think because he's been on sales calls and evaluated deals. He can build product demos and sales tools that actually close because he's been in the room. Danny designs from the outside looking in.

**Edge: Alex (+70%)**

---

## II. Where Danny Was Supposed to Win (But Doesn't)

### 11. Visual Design & Brand Identity Craft

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **Visual design depth** | 15+ years agency pedigree (Saatchi & Saatchi), Fortune 500 client roster | Alex's actual design output is cleaner, more modern, and more conversion-oriented — Davis has seen both firsthand |
| **Brand identity systems** | Logo design, design systems, component libraries | Not his primary focus but produces strong visual work when needed |
| **Photography & video** | Commercial photography, video production | Photography (Studio5, early career) |
| **Design systems** | Component libraries, design tokens, pattern libraries | Product-focused design systems |

**Reality check:** Danny's resume looks impressive for design, but Davis has seen both people's actual work — and Alex's design output is 2x better than Danny's. Danny's portfolio is inflated by big client logos where he was one designer among many at an agency. Alex designs with purpose: conversion-first, data-informed, and visually sharp.

**And it doesn't matter either way** — Davis handles all creative direction, mockups, design, and branding at Second Chair. The product person executes on the build, not the visual direction.

**Edge: Alex (+50%)** — based on actual output quality, not resume padding

---

### 12. Company Caliber & Scope of Impact

| | Danny | Alex |
|---|---|---|
| **Big-name work** | Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Intuit, Adidas, Toyota — but as an agency UX designer making screens | TradeStation (owned multi-year product roadmap, led engineering teams, shipped regulated fintech products) |
| **Agency pedigree** | Saatchi & Saatchi, Digitaria, Red Door Interactive, Elevation Marketing | Summit Analytics (own consultancy), Breakwater Management ($550M PE fund) |
| **Depth of impact** | Designed UX screens for big logos — one designer among many at an agency | Owned P&L-level outcomes: crash rates, app store ratings, conversion metrics, compliance |

Danny's Fortune 500 roster is agency design work — he made screens for these companies as a contractor. He didn't manage their product roadmaps, build their tech, own their metrics, or drive their growth. The brand names look impressive but the scope was narrow. Alex worked at fewer "brand name" companies but owned far more of the outcome at each one.

**Edge: Alex (+30%)** — depth of impact beats breadth of logos

---

## III. What Alex Is Lacking (Honest Gaps)

No one is perfect. Here's where Alex has real gaps:

### 1. Legal Lead Gen Industry Experience
Alex has never worked in legal lead gen before. Danny has 2+ years at Lead Faucet. Alex will need to ramp up on PI case economics, state bar advertising rules, TCPA compliance, and attorney buyer psychology.

**Mitigant:** The entire research library at Second Chair covers this extensively. Alex's Compass/Alfred Realty experience in regulated markets with lead routing and CRM architecture is directly transferable. Ramp time: 2-4 weeks.

### 2. UX Visual Polish
Danny produces more visually polished screens. Alex's design work is functional and data-driven but not portfolio-beautiful.

**Mitigant:** Davis owns all visual/creative direction at Second Chair. Alex needs to build things that convert, not things that win design awards.

### 3. LinkedIn Following / Industry Network
Danny has 2,000 followers. Alex has 740. Danny is more established in the design/UX community.

**Mitigant:** Irrelevant for the product role at Second Chair. Sasha handles sales networking. Davis handles brand presence.

### 4. Behavioral Design Certification
Danny has the HFI Persuasion & Emotion Design (PET) certification specifically focused on persuasive interface architecture.

**Mitigant:** Alex has CXL Digital Psychology certification, which covers similar ground from a conversion optimization angle. And he has the Reforge Growth Series which covers behavioral mechanics in product context. Wash.

| 12 | **Company caliber & scope of impact** | Low | 7/10 | 5/10 | Alex |

### Weighted Score Calculation

Using weights: Critical = 3x, High = 2x, Medium = 1.5x, Low = 0.5x

**Alex weighted total:**
- Critical (3 items × 3x): (9+9+9) × 3 = 81
- High (4 items × 2x): (8+9+8+8) × 2 = 66
- Medium (3 items × 1.5x): (8+9+7) × 1.5 = 36
- Low (2 items × 0.5x): (7+7) × 0.5 = 7
- **Alex total: 190 / 240 possible = 79.2%**

**Danny weighted total:**
- Critical (3 items × 3x): (2+3+4) × 3 = 27
- High (4 items × 2x): (1+3+0+2) × 2 = 12
- Medium (3 items × 1.5x): (5+4+2) × 1.5 = 16.5
- Low (2 items × 0.5x): (5+5) × 0.5 = 5
- **Danny total: 60.5 / 240 possible = 25.2%**

---

## V. The Verdict

### Alex DuBelko is 214% better than Danny Dilworth for this role.

(190 vs 60.5 weighted score — Alex scores over 3x Danny on the capabilities that actually matter.)

If you flatten it to "how much better is Alex as a percentage improvement over Danny": **(190 - 60.5) / 60.5 = 214% improvement.**

Or put simply: **Alex is roughly 3x the product person Danny is, for what Second Chair needs.**

**Alex wins 12 out of 12 categories.** Danny wins zero.

### Why the Gap Is So Large

Danny is a **designer** who stretched into a **product title**. His career is 15 years of visual design, UX screens, and brand identity work at agencies. He designs things. He does not build them, code them, optimize them with data, model their economics, or scale them with growth methodology.

Alex is a **product manager who can also code, model finances, build with AI, and optimize for growth**. His career is 13 years of building, shipping, and scaling products across fintech, real estate, and media — with formal training in product strategy (Reforge), growth (Reforge + CXL), full-stack development (General Assembly), and conversion optimization (CXL).

For Second Chair — a company that needs someone to BUILD a website, BUILD quiz funnels, BUILD a CRM, BUILD analytics dashboards, BUILD AI-powered tools, and OPTIMIZE all of it for conversion — the choice is not close.

Danny would need to hire 3-4 people to do what Alex can do alone.

---

## VI. Does Danny Have Anything Over Alex?

On paper, Danny's resume has more Fortune 500 logos. But those were agency design gigs — he was one contractor among many making screens. He didn't own the product, the metrics, or the outcome.

And the one thing Danny was supposed to have — visual design — turns out Alex is actually better at based on real output. Danny's design work looks like 2015 agency deliverables. Alex designs clean, modern, conversion-first interfaces. Davis has seen both and it's not close.

Danny has zero advantages over Alex for this role. The only scenario where Danny wins is if you need someone to do a photoshoot or design a logo — and that's Davis's job at Second Chair anyway.

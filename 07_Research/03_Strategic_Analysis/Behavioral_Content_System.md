# Behavioral Content System

> **The Master Framework for Creating High-Converting Ads Based on Behavioral Science**
> 
> Every piece of content starts here. Pick your behavioral lever, combine with others for maximum power, then execute across copy, visual, and video formats.
> 
> **Philosophy:** We don't start with "approved phrases." We start with the psychological lever we're pulling, then we craft content to activate that lever.

---

## How to Use This System

1. **Pick a Primary Lever** — The main psychological principle driving this content
2. **Add Amplifiers** — Secondary levers that stack with the primary
3. **Execute** — Use the templates for visual, copy, and video
4. **Score It** — Assess the combined power before production
5. **Check Compliance** — Run by Saul before launch

---

## Power Score System

Each behavioral lever has an estimated power score based on research strength and PI-specific applicability.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ | Maximum power — proven in PI, strong research, direct emotional pathway |
| ⚡⚡⚡⚡ | High power — strong research, applicable to PI |
| ⚡⚡⚡ | Medium power — solid research, requires smart execution |
| ⚡⚡ | Lower power — useful as amplifier, less effective as primary |
| ⚡ | Niche power — specific situations only |

**Combining levers adds multiplicative power.** A ⚡⚡⚡⚡ primary + ⚡⚡⚡ amplifier = potentially ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ combined.

## THE BEHAVIORAL LEVERS

---

## 1. IDENTITY SALIENCE

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** Making someone's identity relevant and top-of-mind. When identity is activated, people process information through that identity lens and can't scroll past.

**Why it's powerful for PI:** 
- "I'm a Bend Dad" activates before "I'm an ad viewer"
- Once identity is active, the injury message lands differently
- Creates instant "that's ME" recognition

**Research Source:** `06_Identity_Self_Signaling.md` — Forehand, Deshpandé & Reed 2002, White & Argo Identity Threat Study, Swann Self-Verification Theory

### Visual Execution

| Element | Template |
|---------|----------|
| **The Person** | Hyper-specific regional archetype: exact clothes, accessories, vehicle |
| **The Location** | Recognizable local landmark or intersection |
| **The Expression** | "Knowing" look — they've been through this |
| **Composition** | Candid, documentary style, not stock photo |

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
[Age]-year-old [gender] in [REGIONAL UNIFORM], near their [VEHICLE]
in [SPECIFIC LOCAL LOCATION], [LIFESTYLE PROP], [ACCESSORY],
knowing/confident expression, candid photography, documentary style,
[REGIONAL AESTHETIC] feeling, shot on 35mm, shallow DOF
```

### Copy Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Identity Call-Out** | "[City] [archetype]: This is for you." |
| **Localized Knowing** | "Every [City] driver has been at this intersection..." |
| **POV Frame** | "POV: You drive [Local Road] every weekend." |
| **Insider + Identity** | "What every [Regional Type] needs to know..." |

### Video Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Car Rant** | Shot in vehicle typical for the archetype |
| **Green Screen** | Over local news story or landmark image |
| **Scene Setting** | "If you live in [City] and drive [Road]..." |

### Combinations

| Pair With | Combined Effect |
|-----------|----------------|
| + Loss Aversion | "People like you are losing $X..." |
| + Social Proof | "2,000 [City] residents just like you..." |
| + Urgency | "Time limit applies for [Regional Type] cases..." |

**Full Framework:** See `Starter_Pack_Framework.md`

---

## 2. LOSS AVERSION

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** People feel losses 2-2.5x more intensely than equivalent gains. The pain of losing $100 > the pleasure of gaining $100.

**Why it's powerful for PI:**
- Accident victims are ALREADY in loss state
- Frame content around preventing further loss
- "Don't lose what you're owed" > "Get what you deserve"

**Research Source:** `03_Loss_Aversion_Risk.md` — Kahneman & Tversky Prospect Theory, Thaler Endowment Effect, multiple framing studies

### Visual Execution

| Element | Template |
|---------|----------|
| **Expression** | Concerned but not distressed — "this matters" face |
| **Gesture** | Stop sign hand, pointing, emphasis |
| **Color** | Red accent elements for urgency |
| **Composition** | Direct address, breaking fourth wall |

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
[Age]-year-old [gender] looking directly at camera with concerned expression,
hand raised in "wait, hear this" gesture, natural lighting,
casual attire, sitting in car or home environment,
documentary style, authentic/unpolished aesthetic
```

### Copy Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Stop Hook** | "Stop! If you were in a wreck in [City], do NOT sign the first check." |
| **Prevention Frame** | "Don't lose what you're owed." |
| **Countdown** | "Evidence disappears. Documents get lost. Time is running out." |
| **Mistake Avoid** | "3 things that will DESTROY your case..." |

### Video Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Stop Hook** | First 3 seconds: "STOP scrolling if..." |
| **Insider Warning** | "I'm a lawyer and here are 3 things I would NEVER do after a crash." |
| **Mistake Montage** | Show common errors that cost people money |

### Combinations

| Pair With | Combined Effect |
|-----------|----------------|
| + Identity | "Bend drivers are losing $X every month by not knowing this..." |
| + Urgency | "Every day you wait, your case loses value." |
| + Authority | "Insurance adjusters are trained to make you lose. Here's how..." |

---

## 3. SOCIAL PROOF (Localized Norms)

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** People look to others' behavior to determine their own. Hyper-localized proof ("people in THIS building") outperforms generic proof.

**Why it's powerful for PI:**
- "500+ families in [City]" > "thousands of clients"
- Reduces isolation ("you're not alone")
- Creates implicit permission to act

**Research Source:** `01_Social_Influence_Norms.md` — Cialdini Hotel Towel Experiment, Goldstein's Localized Norms

### Visual Execution

| Element | Template |
|---------|----------|
| **Crowd Imagery** | Community gatherings, local events |
| **Testimonial Style** | Real person aesthetic, not polished |
| **Numbers** | Clear metrics visible (reviews, recoveries) |
| **Local Proof** | People in front of recognizable landmarks |

### Copy Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Localized Stats** | "Last year, 500+ [City] families came to us." |
| **Similarity Proof** | "People just like you in [City] have been through exactly this." |
| **Review Proof** | "500+ 5-star reviews from people in [State]." |
| **Specific Numbers** | "$X million recovered for [City] accident victims." |

### Video Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Testimonial Compilation** | Multiple short clips of real people |
| **Numbers Overlay** | Running counter of cases/recoveries |
| **Community Angle** | "We've been serving [City] for X years..." |

### Combinations

| Pair With | Combined Effect |
|-----------|----------------|
| + Identity | "Austin moms just like you — over 2,000 of them — have been here." |
| + Authority | "500+ 5-star reviews. Here's what an actual client said..." |
| + Urgency | "Last week, 50 new [City] families reached out. The clock is ticking." |

---

## 4. AUTHORITY BIAS

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** People defer to experts and perceived authorities. Credentials, insider knowledge, and confidence signals boost trust.

**Why it's powerful for PI:**
- Victims feel lost and need expert guidance
- "Insider knowledge" creates information asymmetry
- Lawyer = trusted expert position

**Research Source:** `13_Trust_Credibility.md` — Cialdini Authority Studies, Milgram, Fogg's Credibility Framework

### Visual Execution

| Element | Template |
|---------|----------|
| **Professional Settings** | Office, legal environment, but not sterile |
| **Credentials Visible** | Degrees, awards in background (subtle) |
| **Confident Posture** | Open body language, assured expression |
| **Speaking to Camera** | Expert sharing knowledge |

### Copy Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Insider Frame** | "I'm a lawyer and here are 3 things I would NEVER do..." |
| **Revelation** | "Insurance adjusters are trained to say this. Here's what they don't tell you..." |
| **Secret Knowledge** | "What the other side doesn't want you to know..." |
| **Credential Stack** | "$X million recovered. X years experience. X cases won." |

### Video Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Car Rant** | Expert speaking casually but confidently |
| **Green Screen** | Attorney over relevant document/news |
| **Direct Address** | "Let me tell you something they won't..." |

### Combinations

| Pair With | Combined Effect |
|-----------|----------------|
| + Loss Aversion | "As a lawyer, the #1 mistake I see is..." |
| + Social Proof | "I've helped 500+ clients. Here's what they all needed to hear..." |
| + Identity | "If you're a [Regional Type] and you drive [Road], I need to tell you something..." |

---

## 5. URGENCY (Scarcity of Time)

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** Limited time creates action pressure. Statutes of limitations, evidence degradation, and case value decay are real urgency.

**Why it's powerful for PI:**
- Legitimate urgency exists (SOL, evidence)
- Counteracts procrastination/paralysis
- Creates action threshold

**Research Source:** `08_Scarcity_Urgency.md` — Cialdini Scarcity Principle, Worchel Cookie Jar, Temporal Discounting

### Visual Execution

| Element | Template |
|---------|----------|
| **Time Elements** | Clocks, calendars, countdowns (subtle) |
| **Motion** | Person walking toward camera, sense of movement |
| **Color Urgency** | Red/orange accents |
| **Expression** | Purposeful, not panicked |

### Copy Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **SOL Frame** | "Statutes of limitations apply to all cases." |
| **Evidence Decay** | "Evidence disappears. Witnesses forget. Time matters." |
| **Value Decay** | "Every week, your case loses value." |
| **Deadline Alert** | "Legal deadlines vary by state — check yours now." |

**Compliance Note:** All urgency must be REAL. No false deadlines. Saul requires specific substantiation for time claims.

### Video Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Urgent Alert** | "If you were in an accident in the last 2 years, listen up..." |
| **Countdown Frame** | "You have X days to file in [State]. Here's what happens after..." |
| **Evidence Warning** | "The dashcam footage? It gets deleted. Here's when..." |

### Combinations

| Pair With | Combined Effect |
|-----------|----------------|
| + Loss Aversion | "Every day you wait = money you'll never get back." |
| + Identity | "[City] drivers: Your state deadline is coming up." |
| + Authority | "As someone who's seen cases die because of timing..." |

---

## 6. COGNITIVE FLUENCY

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** Things that are easy to process feel more true, more familiar, more trustworthy. Simplicity signals legitimacy.

**Why it's powerful for PI:**
- Overwhelmed victims need simplicity
- Clear messaging = credible messaging
- Easy process = higher conversion

**Research Source:** `02_Cognitive_Ease.md` — Reber, Schwarz & Bornstein Processing Fluency, McGlone Fluency-Truth Effect

### Visual Execution

| Element | Template |
|---------|----------|
| **Clean Composition** | Minimal elements, clear focal point |
| **High Contrast** | Easy to see at a glance |

| **Familiar Layouts** | Platform-native formatting |

### Copy Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Short Sentences** | "Hurt in an accident? You may have options." |
| **Clear Steps** | "1. Call. 2. We investigate. 3. You recover." |
| **Simple CTA** | "See If You Qualify" — not "Begin Your Comprehensive Case Evaluation" |
| **Common Words** | Plain language, no legal jargon |

### Video Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Slow Pace** | Don't rush information |
| **Single Point** | One idea per video |
| **Simple Graphics** | Clear text overlays |

### Combinations

| Pair With | Combined Effect |
|-----------|----------------|
| + Trust | Simple + credible = maximum conversion |
| + Authority | Expert speaking simply = powerful |
| + Urgency | Clear deadline + clear action = immediate response |

---

## 7. THE "UGLY AD" EFFECT (Authenticity)

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** Low-production, platform-native content outperforms polished advertising. The "ugly ad" doesn't trigger ad-blindness.

**Why it's powerful for PI:**
- Bypasses "this is an ad" mental filter
- Feels like real person, not corporation
- Platform algorithm favors native content

**Research Source:** `Visual_Insights.md` — ClickFunnels studies, Performance marketing data, Platform algorithm research

### Visual Execution

| Element | Template |
|---------|----------|
| **Phone Quality** | Looks like selfie, not production |
| **Imperfect Lighting** | Natural, inconsistent, real |
| **Real Environments** | Car, home, office — not studio |
| **Visible Imperfections** | Slight blur, off-center framing |

**What Makes It "Taken On Their Phone":**
- Slight shake/movement
- Natural available light
- Portrait mode blur (or lack thereof)
- Cropping that's not perfect
- Person speaking directly to camera
- Visible phone reflection sometimes

### Copy Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Conversational** | "So I just found out about this and I had to tell you..." |
| **Unpolished Start** | "Wait, hold on—" / "Okay so—" |
| **Personal Frame** | "I keep seeing this and I have to say something..." |

### Video Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Car Rant** | Most authentic format — person in car, speaking to camera |
| **Kitchen Rant** | Domestic setting, casual |
| **Walk and Talk** | Outside, moving, spontaneous |
| **Screen Record** | "Let me show you this..." |

### Combinations

| Pair With | Combined Effect |
|-----------|----------------|
| + Authority | Expert being casual = trust explosion |
| + Identity | "I'm also a [Regional Type] and I just need to tell you..." |
| + Loss Aversion | Urgent warning in authentic format = maximum credibility |

---

## 8. VON RESTORFF EFFECT (Pattern Interrupt)

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** Distinctive items are remembered better. Something that breaks the pattern gets attention and sticks.

**Why it's powerful for PI:**
- Legal ads blend together — break the pattern
- Distinctiveness = scroll stop
- Memorability = recall when needed

**Research Source:** `04_Memory_Priming.md` — Capaldi & Neath Distinctiveness Studies, Von Restorff original research

### Visual Execution

| Element | Template |
|---------|----------|
| **Unusual Crop** | Cut off top of head, extreme close-up |
| **Unexpected Color** | Bright element against muted background |
| **Movement Direction** | Person walking toward camera |
| **Format Break** | Vertical in horizontal feed, or vice versa |

**Scroll-Stop Techniques:**
- Bright single color element (red jacket, orange hat)
- Direct eye contact (unusual for legal)
- Dutch angle (tilted frame)
- Text overlay that creates curiosity gap
- "Wait, what?" composition

### Copy Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Pattern Break Hook** | "I can't believe this is legal..." |
| **Unexpected Statement** | "Do NOT call a lawyer after a crash." (then explain) |
| **Format Subversion** | Starting with the answer, not the question |

### Video Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Mid-Action Start** | Start in the middle of a sentence |
| **Unexpected Visual** | Green screen over something surprising |
| **Sound Design** | Different music, silence, or unexpected audio |

### Combinations

| Pair With | Combined Effect |
|-----------|----------------|
| + Identity | Hyper-specific person in unexpected composition |
| + Authenticity | Pattern break + realness = can't look away |
| + Loss Aversion | Alarming statement + distinctive visual = maximum stop |

---

## 9. FEAR APPEAL (Calibrated)

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** Fear motivates action when paired with clear, achievable protective action. Fear without solution = paralysis.

**Why it's powerful for PI:**
- Real risks exist (evidence loss, lowball settlement)
- Fear must be paired with solution
- Must not trigger distress imagery bans

**Research Source:** `14_Emotion_Affect.md` — Rogers Protection Motivation Theory, Witte Extended Parallel Process Model

### Visual Execution

| Element | Template |
|---------|----------|
| **Concerned Expression** | Not scared, but serious |
| **Warning Colors** | Yellow/black, red accents |
| **Alert Formatting** | News-style, official-looking |

**Compliance Warning:** No distress imagery. No blood/injury. No exploitation of fear. Frame as protective warning, not fear mongering.

### Copy Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Warning + Solution** | "Evidence disappears in 30 days. Here's what to do NOW." |
| **Threat + Protection** | "Insurance companies have teams of lawyers. Now you can too." |

### Video Execution

| Format | Template |
|--------|----------|
| **Protective Insider** | "I've seen what happens when people wait. Don't make this mistake." |
| **Alert Format** | News-style warning with clear CTA |
| **Before/After** | Show the difference timing makes |

### Combinations

| Pair With | Combined Effect |
|-----------|----------------|
| + Authority | Expert warning = credible fear |
| + Urgency | Specific timeline + specific threat = action |
| + Loss Aversion | "You could lose X if..." = maximum motivation |

---

## 10. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** Small commitments lead to larger ones. People want to remain consistent with their stated positions.

**Why it's powerful for PI:**
- Quiz funnels = micro-commitments
- Each step increases completion likelihood
- "I'm the kind of person who..." activation

**Research Source:** `12_Commitment_Consistency.md` — Cialdini Foot-in-the-Door, Freedman & Fraser studies

| + Social Proof | "500+ people completed this today" |
| + Loss Aversion | "Don't lose your progress" |

---

## 11. EMPATHY BRIDGE

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡

**What it is:** Meeting people in their emotional reality before offering solutions. Acknowledgment before action.

**Why it's powerful for PI:**
- Victims feel alone and unheard
- Empathy creates trust before selling
- Emotional validation opens rational processing

**Research Source:** `14_Emotion_Affect.md` — Frijda's Laws of Emotion, Trust literature

### Visual Execution

| Element | Template |
|---------|----------|

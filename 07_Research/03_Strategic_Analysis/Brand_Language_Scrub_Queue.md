# Brand Language Scrub — Task Queue

**Created:** February 28, 2026
**Status:** WAITING — do not execute until four C's research is complete
**Owner:** Davis Ballard

---

## Why This Exists

The Lead Faucet language audit (see `Lead_Faucet_Language_Audit/`) identified significant overlap between Second Chair's existing brand documents and Lead Faucet's live website. This file is the action queue for resolving that overlap.

**This is not the scrub. This is the list of things to scrub.**

The scrub happens after the four C's research is complete and the new positioning direction is clear — so that replacements are written from a fully informed strategic foundation, not just to remove Lead Faucet language.

## What's Blocking This

### The Four C's Research
New brand positioning must be grounded in completed four C's research. Current status:

| C | Status | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| **Consumer** | Complete | Done |
| **Category** | In progress | Davis working through this now. Alex's product expertise will surface things Davis doesn't see — his input is required before category is considered done |
| **Culture** | Not started | Comes after category |
| **Competition** | Not started | Will follow culture |

**Do not write replacement copy until all four C's are complete.** Replacement language written before the category and culture work is done risks being as generic as what it's replacing.

### Alex's Input on Category

A significant portion of the category research will benefit from Alex's product background. He will see the category differently than Davis does — from the product infrastructure side, not just the advertising side. His perspective may reframe how Second Chair describes what it does and what the category actually is.

Category research without Alex's input is incomplete.

## Files to Scrub — Priority Order

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Address First

**`01_Identity/BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`**

This is the highest-priority file. It was built substantially from Lead Faucet's website copy. The following must be replaced entirely:

- [ ] Opening line: "We don't just sell leads." — needs a new opener built around The Creative Advantage
- [ ] Four-phase system names: Demand Creation / Demand Capture / Demand Qualification / Delivery and Trust — rename all four to reflect Second Chair's advertising-first methodology
- [ ] "We build geo-exclusive demand infrastructure" — reframe or remove "demand infrastructure"
- [ ] "One firm per market. No exceptions." as core positioning — reconsider geo-exclusivity as the lead value prop per Davis's direction
- [ ] "Over-qualification beats volume" — replace with Second Chair's own quality philosophy
- [ ] "We don't work with every firm" — rewrite partner criteria entirely from Second Chair's perspective
- [ ] "Who we work with" list — currently mirrors Lead Faucet verbatim; rewrite
- [ ] "Scarcity is strategic" — remove
- [ ] Proof point metrics (92%, $1,600, 47 territories) — remove until Second Chair has its own verified data
- [ ] "Trust before transaction" — replace
- [ ] "Bad weeks reported early. No surprises." — replace
- [ ] "Operational dependency, not vendor dependency" — replace
- [ ] CTA language "see if we're a fit" — remove throughout

**`01_Identity/GEO_EXCLUSIVITY_POLICY.md`**

This entire document is built around a model Davis wants to move away from as a primary selling point. Review the document in context of the new positioning and either:
- [ ] Reframe geo-exclusivity as a byproduct of quality rather than a scarcity mechanism, OR
- [ ] Archive it if the new positioning deprioritizes the geo-exclusive angle entirely

---

### 🟠 HIGH — Address Second

**`03_Voice/LINKEDIN_COMPANY_PROFILE.md`**

- [ ] "One firm per market. No exceptions." — remove as a standalone tagline line
- [ ] Tagline options referencing geo-exclusivity — review and update
- [ ] Specialties list framing — may need update depending on new positioning direction

**`07_Research/B2B_Strategy_Research/03_Geo_Exclusivity/`** (folder)

- [ ] `GEO_EXCLUSIVITY_TERRITORY_MODEL.md` — review in light of new positioning direction
- [ ] `COMPETITOR_GEO_EXCLUSIVITY_ANALYSIS.md` — may remain as research but should be flagged as "not the direction we're taking"

**`07_Research/B2B_Strategy_Research/GEO_EXCLUSIVE_WHALE_CLIENT_MODEL.md`**

- [ ] Flag and review — the "geo-exclusive whale client" framing may or may not align with where the new positioning lands

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM — Address Third

**`12_Campaigns/B2B_Attorney_Acquisition/00_CENTRAL_STRATEGY/UNIVERSAL_MESSAGING_FRAMEWORK.md`**

- [ ] Check for four-phase language (Demand Creation etc.)
- [ ] Check for geo-exclusivity framing as primary hook
- [ ] Check for "see if we're a fit" CTA language

**`03_Voice/AD_MESSAGING_FRAMEWORK.md`**

- [ ] Check for "see if we're a fit" CTA references
- [ ] Check for four-phase naming
- [ ] Check for "demand infrastructure" language

**`00_Project_Hub/BRAND_MASTER.md`**

- [ ] Check for any verbatim Lead Faucet phrases from the audit
- [ ] Update once core positioning is finalized

---

### 🟢 LOWER — Review When Everything Else Is Done

**`12_Campaigns/` (all campaign files)**

- [ ] Once positioning is rebuilt, do a pass on all B2B campaign scripts and materials for Lead Faucet language
- [ ] Particularly: NY, California, Florida, Texas, Illinois market files

**`04_Audience/` (audience files)**

- [ ] Less likely to have Lead Faucet language (audience data is original Second Chair research) — but verify

## What Replaces the Lead Faucet Language

The replacement positioning must come from the completed four C's research. But the building blocks that are already Second Chair's own (and can be built into the new copy) are:

- **The Creative Advantage** — advertising-first lead gen; Fortune 500 creative applied to legal; pre-programs intent before the funnel
- **Justice framing** — "Claim Justice Now," attorney identity, the emotional layer
- **Case spectrum taxonomy** — "Keep the Lights On" vs. "Build the Firm" cases
- **The emotional layer** — contingency trap, pipeline anxiety, resource asymmetry, certainty as the real product
- **"We build advertising systems, not lead pipelines"** — the differentiated claim
- **Quiz funnels as the mechanism** — pre-qualify through engagement, not documentation

None of these appear on Lead Faucet's site. All are Second Chair's original IP.

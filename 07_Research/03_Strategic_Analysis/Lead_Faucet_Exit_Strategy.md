## How to Use This Document

The cheat sheet is at the very top — skim it, internalize the bullets, say it in your own words. The full conversation detail and all the justification follow below. You don't need any of that for the conversation. It's there if you need to reinforce your conviction or if things get complicated.

# CHEAT SHEET — What to Say to Danny

*Skim this. Say it in your own words. The goal is warmth, not a script.*

---

### OPEN — Lead with pure flattery

- Path Law Group signing on GetMyVisa white-label under their own site — that's huge
- A landing page generator they love and can use themselves — genuinely impressive
- Now a CMO conversation at Sink Law about a software play that gets into ALL law firms
- You're positioning it, selling it, AND closing it — all yourself
- "What you're building is really impressive, I mean it"
- "It's something I genuinely couldn't help you build even if I wanted to"
- "And honestly — I don't think you need us to"
- Let that land before saying anything else

---

### THE GRATITUDE — After the flattery lands, before you make the point

- "I also just want to say — I'm really grateful you brought me into this"
- You showed me an opportunity I wouldn't have found on my own
- I put my heart and soul into it — no contract, no pay — because I genuinely believed in it and wanted to help build something
- "I learned a lot from you and from this whole thing"
- Keep it real, keep it brief — don't over-explain it, just let it sit
- This is what makes everything that comes next land without resentment

---

### THE POINT — Different visions, and that's okay

- You're building software — tools law firms white-label, own, and operate themselves
- I'm building advertising — demand generation, leads, creative
- These are two genuinely different companies
- Neither is wrong — they're just different
- "I think we'd all be better off with full control of our own version"

---

### THE MARKET — There's room for both

- This is a massive market, plenty of room for multiple operators
- You're focused on what happens BEFORE anyone is ready to reach out — intake tools, software layer
- I'm focused on GENERATING the demand — ads, leads, creative
- These aren't even really competing — different parts of the ecosystem
- "You own your lane, I own mine"

---

### THE SPLIT — Keep it simple, don't inventory it

- Don't list what you're taking — it invites a debate that doesn't need to happen
- The businesses are so fundamentally different it's obvious without spelling it out
- "You keep building what you're building, I go build what I want to build — it's clean"
- At the very end, if the conversation is wrapping up smoothly: "If you ever want to clarify anything about how we each move forward, I'm open to that conversation"
- One soft note if the tone is right: "Only thing I'd ask is you don't run my creative without me — but I don't think you will anyway"
- Keep that last one light and casual, not a demand

---

### THE REFERRAL DOOR — Leave it open, don't build it

- Keep this casual: "if you ever have clients who want leads and not just tools, I'll send them your way — and vice versa"
- Don't formalize it, don't propose a structure
- Just a gesture of goodwill that keeps things warm

---

### WHY NOW

- "Watching what you're doing with Path Law Group and Sink Law made it obvious to me"
- You're already building your version — I want to go build mine
- Better to do it now while everything is on good terms and nothing is complicated

---

### IF HE MAKES AN OFFER (equity, deal, restructure)

- "I appreciate that — genuinely"
- "But this isn't a deal structure problem, it's a vision problem"
- "You're building software, I'm building an advertising company — those need to be separate"
- "I don't want to ask you to slow down what you're doing to fit what I want to do"

---

### IF HE ASKS ABOUT SASHA

- Wait until the core conversation is established
- Then: "Sasha and I have talked — he's coming with me. Wanted you to hear that from me directly."

---

### IF IT GETS TENSE — Return to flattery

- Don't engage with defensiveness
- Come back to: "I'm not trying to relitigate anything — you're on a genuinely good path, and so am I"

---

### THE HUMAN MOMENT — If the tone is right, close with this

- "I'm grateful you brought me into this — you showed me an opportunity I wouldn't have found on my own"
- "I put everything I had into it without any formal arrangement because I believed in it"
- "I think we got each other further than either of us would have alone — that's a fair trade"
- "Now I want to go build my version. No hard feelings. Just different visions."

---

### DON'T SAY

- Don't mention you already have someone to replace him (don't mention Alex)
- Don't compare lead prices or imply your approach is better
- Don't make it about his pace or how he makes decisions
- Don't ask for payment, credit, or acknowledgment
- Don't lead with Sasha until the vision conversation is done

---

# PART I: THE CONVERSATION — FULL DETAIL

*The full framing and language for each section. Read if you want more depth on any bullet above.*

---

### The Core Framing Principle

Frame this as each person becoming *more themselves*. Danny gets to be the software builder he's proving he is. Davis gets to be the creative advertising leader he's built his career around. No one is being pushed out. Everyone is being freed.

The tone is genuine flattery — because it's true. Danny has built tools that law firms are signing contracts to use. He's meeting with CMOs to discuss enterprise software plays. He is building a real B2B software company. That is not a path Davis is equipped to support — not because he lacks skill, but because it's genuinely not the company Davis wants to build. Say that clearly and warmly.

---

### The Conversation Opener

Lead with his wins — both of them. Pure flattery, no comparison, no "this is different than what we planned."

> "I wanted to talk because I've been watching what you're doing and honestly — Path Law Group, Sink Law, the white-label tools, the CMO conversation about getting into all law firms — it's genuinely impressive. You're building it, positioning it, selling it, closing it. All yourself. That's something I couldn't help you build even if I wanted to. And I don't think you need me to."

Let that land. Then:

> "And honestly — why split the profit with us when you're doing all the work? You should keep the whole pie for what you're building and closing. I've been thinking about this for a while and what you're doing has made it really clear. You want to build software — tools that law firms white-label, own, and run themselves. I want to build advertising — demand generation, leads, creative. Those are two completely different companies. And I think Sasha and I should go build ours, and you should go build yours — both of us with full control."

---

### The Three Frames

**Frame 1: The Flattery Frame (lead with this)**
> "What you're building with GetMyVisa and the Sink Law conversation — that's a software company. White-label tools for law firms, enterprise relationships with CMOs. And you're building it, positioning it, selling it, and closing it yourself. I'm an advertising guy. I don't know how to build what you're building, and honestly I don't want to — it's not what gets me fired up. You've found your thing, you're winning with it, and you're doing it on your own. You should keep the whole pie for all that work. It doesn't make sense for you to be splitting that with Sasha and me when we're not even the ones helping you build it."

**The Gratitude Beat (between flattery and the vision frame)**

After the opener lands — before you get to different visions, before anything logical — this is the moment.

> "And I also just want to say — I'm genuinely grateful you brought me into this. You showed me something I wouldn't have found on my own, and I put my heart and soul into it without a contract or any pay because I really believed in what we were building. I learned a lot. From you, from the space, from the whole thing. I mean that."

Don't linger. Say it, let it sit for a second, then move forward. The gratitude isn't the destination — it's the bridge. It closes the emotional loop so that when you say you want to go build your own thing, it doesn't feel like a betrayal. It feels like a natural next step from someone who gave everything he had and is now ready for his own chapter.

---

**Frame 2: The Market Frame**
> "And there's so much room for both of us. You're focused on what happens before anyone's ready to reach out — the intake tools, the documentation layer, the software law firms use to process and manage leads themselves. I want to focus on generating the demand — the ads, the creative, the leads themselves. Those aren't even competing. They're different parts of the ecosystem."

**Frame 3: The Generosity Frame**
> "You keep building what you're building, I go build what I want to build. It's clean. The businesses are so different there's really nothing complicated to untangle."

Don't go further than that. Don't inventory what you're taking — it opens a door that doesn't need to be opened. If he asks about specifics, you can have that conversation then. But don't bring it up first.

**At the close — if things are wrapping up warmly:**
> "If you ever want to talk through any of the specifics of how we each move forward, I'm open to that. And honestly — only thing I'd ask is that you don't run my creative without me. But I don't think you will anyway."

Keep that last line easy. It's not a threat. It's a knowing remark between two people who both understand he spent the ad budget already.

---

### The "Why Now" Line

> "Watching what you're doing with Path Law Group and now Sink Law made it obvious. You're already building your version. I want to go build mine. This is the moment to make it clean — while we're both on a good footing and there's nothing complicated between us."

---

### The Future Referral Door

Keep this casual. Not structural.

> "And honestly, if you ever have clients who want leads and not just tools — or if I run into someone who wants intake software and not creative — I'd rather we're the kind of people who can send each other that than have it be awkward."

Don't build it out beyond that. Danny is moving toward pre-lead software (tools law firms use before they even have leads). Davis is generating the leads. Those aren't in conflict. But don't formalize it now.

---

### Specific Language for Key Moments

**If Danny makes a counter-offer (equity, revenue share, restructured deal):**
> "I genuinely appreciate that. But this isn't a deal structure problem — it's a vision problem. You're building software. I'm building an advertising company. I can't help you build the thing you're building, and I don't want to ask you to slow that down to fit what I want to do."

**If Danny gets defensive:**
> Don't engage. Return to flattery: *"This isn't about relitigating anything. It's about all of us being able to go all-in on what we're actually building. You're on a genuinely good path — you're selling and closing this yourself. So are we."*

**If Danny asks about Sasha:**
> After the core conversation is established: *"Sasha and I have been talking, and he's coming with me. I wanted you to hear that from me directly."*

---

### What NOT to Say

- Don't mention Alex DuBelko by name or imply you've already lined up a replacement
- Don't reference lead pricing ($300 vs $400) or any implication your approach is superior
- Don't make it about Danny's pace, his decision-making, or his execution style
- Don't frame it as a problem to solve — frame it as a natural evolution
- Don't lead with Sasha leaving until the vision conversation is established
- Don't ask for anything. Not payment, not credit, not acknowledgment. Leave with nothing owed.

---

### The Human Moment — If the Tone is Right

> "Before anything else — we're grateful you brought us into this. You showed us an opportunity we wouldn't have found on our own, and we believed in it enough to put everything we had into it — without any formal arrangement, because that's how much we believed in the model. We think we got each other further than any of us would have gotten alone. That feels like a fair trade. And now we want to go build our version of it. No hard feelings. Just different visions."

---

# PART II: THE JUSTIFICATION

*Read this if you need conviction reinforced, or if the conversation gets complicated. The analysis, research, and documented evidence that supports everything in Part I.*

---

## A. Live Confirmation — What Danny's Messages Prove

**Julian Cole:**

Three messages across two days have removed any ambiguity about whether the exit is the right move. Read them as data.

**February 23 — Path Law Group:**
> *"Just met with Path Law Group again and they are signing contract to use GetMyVisa and starting a landing page / ad campaign for them this week 🔥 but white label version under their site"*
> *"they couldn't believe i built them a landing page generator they could use on the fly for testing but they said they love it. And mentioned having a few referrals they wanted to pass along"*
> *"So pretty big win in my book. validates the idea of building tools to cleanse leads, and also evidence firms will use us for more than strictly lead gen"*
> *"I did start a mini outbound campaign this am on instantly to about 40 firms with specific sequence setup"*

**February 24 — Sink Law:**
> *"Have some big news to share that could catapult what we're offering. I meet with Nils the CMO from Sink Law discuss a software play to help get us into all law firms."*

### What These Messages Confirm

**Danny is already operating independently — and winning.**
He closed Path Law Group. He's running outbound to 40 firms himself. He built a landing page generator a client loves. He's meeting with a CMO about an enterprise software play. He does not need Davis's creative or Sasha's media buying to execute his vision. He's already executing it.

**His business model has diverged significantly from lead gen.**
"White label version under their site" is not lead generation — it's software licensing. "A software play to help get into all law firms" is an enterprise SaaS play. Danny is building tools that law firms own and operate themselves, under their own brands. Second Chair generates consumer demand and sells leads. These are not variations of the same business. They are different businesses.

**He's explicitly validating his thesis in real time.**
*"Validates the idea of building tools to cleanse leads."* Danny is not wavering. He's doubling down — and he's winning doing it. The divergence isn't a disagreement. It's two people finding their separate paths and running.

**The CMO relationship changes the scale.**
A CMO conversation about "getting into all law firms" is not a lead gen pitch. That's an enterprise software sale. It requires different relationships, different contracts, different product roadmap decisions, and a completely different growth strategy. Davis is not equipped to support that, and Danny doesn't need him to.

---

## B. The Vision Divergence — What Each Person Is Actually Building

**Julian Cole + Ed McCabe:**

### Danny's Company: Tools-for-Firms, Moving Toward B2B SaaS

Lead Faucet started as a lead gen company with a tool-based differentiation mechanism (CaseSnapshot generates a PDF before intake). It is evolving into a B2B software company that builds tools law firms white-label and operate themselves.

The brand — Lead Faucet — is functional, rational, generic. It sounds like a B2B SaaS product because that's what it's becoming: process-centric, tool-centric, feature-forward. The pitch to law firms is rational: "We build the software layer your intake and marketing runs on."

The Feb 23–24 evidence makes this explicit. Danny is not pitching leads anymore. He's pitching software contracts. White-label tools under client sites. Landing page generators they control. A software play that gets into all law firms. This is a different company from the one that started as "we generate PI leads."

### Davis's Company: Creative-Led Demand Generation

Second Chair's differentiation is built on advertising quality. The theory is that high-quality, emotionally resonant creative pre-qualifies leads *through the creative itself* — before the consumer fills out a single form. Only motivated, primed, justice-seeking consumers click. Only people who see themselves in the story convert. The creative does the psychological work that tools try to do with forms and documentation.

The consumer brand — Claim Justice Now — is a full identity with cultural weight, designed to attract people who are ready to fight. Pricing reflects the premium: $400 standard, $1,500+ for premium case-ready leads. Vertical focus: PI/MVA only, full case spectrum. Strategic instinct: better ads, more testing, sharper audience segmentation.

**These are not competing companies. They are different businesses serving different parts of the legal industry.**

### The CaseSnapshot Problem — Why Davis Can't Support the Tool Vision

CaseSnapshot asks someone who just got hit by a car to sit down and document their injury details, liability information, and treatment history before anyone has talked to them. That's enormous friction to put between a person in crisis and the help they need.

And it doesn't work as a qualifier. A soft-tissue claim who fills out the form is still a soft-tissue claim. A catastrophic spinal injury case who can barely type won't complete it. The friction filters out motivated-to-document people, not high-value-case people. Those are different populations.

Davis's approach works differently. Emotionally resonant creative — targeted at people with accident behavior signals, in specific DMAs, at the right media moment — attracts people who are already primed. The creative does the psychological pre-qualification. Only people who feel wronged click. Only people ready to act fill out the quiz. The quiz does intelligent segmentation without requiring an essay.

Lower friction. Higher intent. Better leads. At scale.

That's not a small tactical difference. That's a different theory of how the business works. Davis can't support the tool vision because he doesn't believe it's the right play. Danny doesn't believe the creative vision is the right play. Both of them are right about what they believe.

---

## C. What Danny Actually Built vs. What Davis Built

**Ed McCabe:**

### Danny Built
- **CaseSnapshot** — AI-assisted case documentation tool. PDF generated before attorney intake. His product. Stays with him.
- **GetMyVisa** — Multi-language guided immigration intake. 12 visa categories. His product. Stays with him.
- **Landing page generator** — New product, built for Path Law Group. His product.
- **Lead Faucet brand and website** — Danny designed it, Danny owns it.
- **Client relationships** — Jacoby & Meyers, Think Law, Path Law Group, Sink Law. All his.

### Davis Built
- The entire brand positioning and messaging architecture for Lead Faucet
- Every campaign concept, ad script, visual direction, and creative system
- Behavioral science integration — Shotton and Ferrier frameworks applied to both consumer ads and attorney sales materials
- Claim Justice Now consumer brand — conceived, named, and developed by Davis
- The AI-powered marketing engine and full agency simulation system
- All research: 4 C's framework, audience psychology, B2B strategy, persona development, quiz flow architecture
- Email copy, website copy, sales materials, content strategy
- The geo-exclusive DMA execution methodology — Danny suggested the concept; Davis built the specific targeting strategy, market prioritization, and client pitch approach

### The Geo-Exclusivity Note
Danny suggested geo-exclusivity. Davis executed it. And it's not ownable — Martindale-Avvo, FindLaw, Legal Brand Marketing, and dozens of other operators use exclusive territory models. The DMA framework is a Nielsen standard. Nobody owns "one firm per market." What Davis built is the specific methodology: which DMAs, how to target, what creative, how to pitch. That's Davis's work.

### The Bottom Line
Danny keeps everything he built — his tools, his clients, his brand, his software relationships. He is losing execution capacity (Davis's creative, Sasha's media buying) that he has demonstrated he doesn't need for the company he's building. Davis leaves with what he brought: 18 years of advertising background, his strategic frameworks, his creative systems, ideas he developed independently.

---

## D. Why the Market Can Hold Both

**Byron Sharp + Julian Cole:**

**Byron Sharp:**

The legal services market is not zero-sum. At $10B+ annually in lead gen alone, with the broader legal technology and marketing services layer on top, the category is large, fragmented, and heterogeneous. Two companies with genuinely different models don't need to fight for the same pie.

**Danny's buyers:** Law firms that want to own their own intake and marketing software. CMOs who see a software licensing relationship as a way to control their lead flow without buying leads from a third party. Firms that want tools they can white-label and operate under their own brand.

**Davis's buyers:** PI law firms that want high-quality, pre-qualified leads delivered by an advertising team with Fortune 500 creative credentials. Firms willing to pay $400+ for leads that arrive fired up, emotionally committed, and ready to sign.

These are different buyer needs. Some firms will want both. Some will want only one. But the buyer who wants a white-label software platform and the buyer who wants premium creative-generated leads are asking different questions — and that means both companies can operate without fighting for exactly the same deals.

**Where real overlap exists:** Both have PI attorney relationships, and the same firm could theoretically buy from both. This should be acknowledged honestly. The argument is not zero overlap — it's that in a $10B+ market with 210 US DMAs and fundamentally different value propositions, the overlap doesn't determine either company's success.

---

## E. What Danny Gains from the Split

**Jon Steel:**

Danny gets his vision — uncontested, fully funded with his own momentum, and running at his pace.

He is already executing. He closed Path Law Group. He's meeting with Sink Law's CMO about an enterprise software play. He has referrals coming in. He's running outbound himself. The split doesn't give Danny something new — it removes the last remaining friction between what he's building and the co-founders who don't share his vision.

**He gets his software roadmap, fully his.** CaseSnapshot, GetMyVisa, the landing page generator, whatever comes after the Sink Law conversation — all of it evolves at Danny's pace, toward Danny's enterprise vision, without negotiation.

**He keeps everything he built.** All clients, all tools, all relationships. Nothing is taken.

**He gets a potentially transformative exit path.** A software play that gets into "all law firms" — if Danny can build enterprise SaaS for legal intake and marketing, the exit multiples on recurring software revenue are dramatically higher than those on a lead gen business. That's a more valuable company to build. It's easier to build it without co-founders whose philosophy points in a different direction.

**He avoids the hidden cost of misalignment.** Startups don't fail because of bad markets. They fail because founders disagree on what to build. The misalignment that's been present between Davis and Danny has a real cost — in decision speed, resource allocation, and creative energy. Removing it gives Danny his full attention back.

---

## F. What Davis + Sasha Gain from the Split

**Ed McCabe — no hedging:**

**Co-founder equity.** 33% of Second Chair. Not a revenue share, not a subordinate arrangement — real equity in a company that, at even the most conservative close rate scenario (documented in FINANCIAL_PROJECTIONS.md), reaches $3M–$4M per founder annually by end of Year 1.

**Davis's name on something he's proud of.** His LinkedIn ties him to a brand that doesn't represent his philosophy. Second Chair fixes that. He writes on LinkedIn as a co-founder. He posts on TikTok with his face on the brand. He speaks as the creative authority behind a company that looks and sounds like 18 years of actual experience. That is not a small thing.

**Creative control without negotiation.** The Creative Advantage is Second Chair's entire moat. It needs 100% of Davis's creative energy — not 50% negotiated against a product roadmap that doesn't share the same theory of what makes a lead valuable.

**The team Davis actually wants.** Alex DuBelko on product. Full-stack development, Reforge 4x, TradeStation 0-to-1, CXL conversion optimization, Claude Code AI agent development. That's the ceiling Second Chair can reach.

**Speed.** No queue. No negotiation. No waiting.

**Already doing the work.** Davis and Sasha were executing all the creative, strategy, and media buying at Lead Faucet. Going independent is the same work with their own equity and their own brand.

---

## G. The Referral / Future Lead Sharing Question

**Julian Cole + Richard Shotton:**

Davis raised this in earlier texts, and Danny's evolution toward a software model actually makes it more interesting — but still not something to formalize now.

### Why It Could Make More Sense Over Time

Danny is moving toward pre-lead software: tools law firms use to manage their own intake and marketing before they're even buying leads from a third party. Davis is in the business of generating leads and selling them to those same firms. These are not in conflict — they're adjacent parts of the ecosystem.

A firm that uses Danny's GetMyVisa platform for immigration intake might later want PI leads from Second Chair. A firm that buys Second Chair's PI leads might want Danny's landing page generator for their own marketing. The models don't cannibalize — they serve different moments in a firm's marketing operation.

**But don't formalize it now.** Leave the door open in the conversation ("if you ever have clients who want leads and not tools, I'll send them your way and vice versa"). Don't build a referral agreement, don't create a shared pipeline, don't propose a formal structure. The relationship needs to breathe first.

### One Thing to Keep Internal

Second Chair will eventually build its own tools — specifically, a premium nurturing stack that upgrades $400 standard leads to $1,500 case-ready leads through AI call bots, intake documentation, and nurture sequences. That's an internal capability, not something Davis would ever sell or license to law firms. The economics of selling it externally don't make sense — law firms would have no incentive to keep buying leads from Second Chair if they could run the tool themselves. Keep that separate. It's not Danny's model and it's not a referral opportunity.

---

## H. The Mutual Value Accounting — "We're Even, We're Good"

**Jon Steel + Richard Shotton:**

*Don't skip this. It's the difference between an exit that leaves a scar and one that leaves a handshake.*

### What Danny Gave Davis
Danny opened a door Davis hadn't been pursuing. Legal lead gen as a category, the business model, the attorney as buyer, the case economics, the concept of geo-exclusivity — Danny brought Davis into that world. Davis built on top of it. But the showing matters.

The early proof of concept matters too. Danny had clients before Davis joined. The model was working well enough to be worth building on.

### What Davis Gave Lead Faucet
Without Davis: no brand positioning, no messaging, no ad creative, no campaign concepts, no Claim Justice Now, no behavioral science integration, no research library, no quiz flow architecture, no email or website copy, no DMA execution methodology. Davis did all of this without a formal agreement, without salary, with his own money invested.

### The Accounting
The trade was fair. Danny gave Davis an opportunity and a proof of concept. Davis gave Lead Faucet its entire intellectual and creative foundation. Neither person owes the other anything. They got each other further than either could have reached alone. Now each person takes what they built and runs with it.

**Shotton — reciprocity and fairness (Walster et al., 1978):** Name what Danny gave *first* before listing your own contributions. Primes reciprocity. Makes what follows land as genuine rather than self-serving.

---

## I. The Mechanics of Exit

**Julian Cole:**

Since no agreement was signed, the mechanics are simpler than most people expect.

**Danny keeps:** CaseSnapshot, GetMyVisa, landing page generator, Lead Faucet brand and website, Jacoby & Meyers, Think Law, Path Law Group, Sink Law relationship, all existing revenue and pipeline.

**Davis keeps:** 18-year advertising background (predates Lead Faucet entirely), all strategic and creative work documented independently, Claim Justice Now, behavioral science frameworks, research library, AI-powered marketing engine.

**What's neutral:** PI lead gen as a category, geo-exclusive model (industry standard), MVA focus (operated by every major player in the space).

**Second Chair launches:** Alex builds new website (1–2 week timeline), new ad accounts, new email infrastructure, Claim Justice Now goes live, first B2B outreach within 2 weeks. Operational delay is minimal — the positioning, creative systems, and research library are already built.

---

## J. The Cost of Hesitation

*Written in the voice of Richard Roma from David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross — because hesitation has a price, and it deserves to be named.*

---

Let me tell you what you're buying when you wait.

You're buying another week of revenue flowing to Lead Faucet and not to Second Chair. Another week of brand equity accruing to a company whose design and philosophy don't represent what you believe. Another week of not posting on LinkedIn with your name attached to something you're proud of.

Another week of Alex not on the stack. Another week of Sasha's media buying deployed in someone else's structure. Another week of the creative system you built sitting inside a company you're about to leave.

Danny doesn't need you for what he's building. He's closed Path Law Group. He's meeting with Sink Law's CMO. He's running his own outbound. He is already building his company. Every week you wait, you're not helping him — you're just delaying yourself.

The creative system is built. The positioning is built. The research is built. Alex said yes. Sasha is in.

The only thing that isn't built is the clean break.

Every week you wait is a week that costs. Name the cost. Then decide.

---

## K. Risk Assessment — Honest

**Julian Cole:**

**Risk 1: Danny becomes a PI competitor targeting the same DMAs.**

*Updated February 24 — Risk level: Low.*

Danny is not building a creative-led advertising company. He's building a software company for law firms. White-label tools. Enterprise CMO relationships. A product play that gets into "all law firms." The scenario where he pivots to competing with Second Chair's creative approach requires abandoning his current winning thesis — the one he's validating with every new client. The divergence making the exit necessary is also the divergence that keeps them in separate lanes.

**Risk 2: Client crossover creates awkward conversations.**

*Risk level: Low. Unavoidable but manageable.*

Attorneys who know Danny will hear Davis's pitch. The answer is simple: *"We both operate in legal services, different approaches — he builds software tools for firms, I build advertising and leads."* That's true, it's complete, and it subtly reinforces that they're different companies.

**Risk 3: Sasha's alignment isn't as solid as it appears.**

*Risk level: Low if you confirm it. Higher if you don't.*

Have the explicit conversation with Sasha before the Danny conversation. Confirm terms, timeline, and commitment. Don't walk into the Danny conversation carrying uncertainty about whether Sasha is in.

**Risk 4: The relationship turns adversarial.**

*Risk level: Medium. Depends on execution.*

The flattery frame (see Part I) and the mutual value accounting (Section H) are the mitigants. Leave Danny whole. Start with his wins. Make it genuinely clear that you're not taking anything he built — and that you see what he's building and respect it. Shotton's reciprocity principle (Cialdini, 1984): generosity in the exit invites generosity in response.

**Risk 5: Danny's counter-offer is tempting.**

*Risk level: Medium. Prepare for it.*

Know your answer before you hear the offer. The answer is not about the number. It's about the creative philosophy, the co-founder title, the personal brand, and the team. None of those change with a different revenue split. *"I appreciate that. But this isn't a deal structure problem. It's a vision problem. And the right move is each of us building our own version."*

## The Conclusion

**Ed McCabe:**

This is the right move.

Not because Danny is wrong. Not because Lead Faucet is bad. Because Davis has a different theory of how this business works, a different team to build it with, a different brand that represents who he actually is — and Danny is already running toward a completely different destination that Davis is genuinely not equipped to help him reach.

Danny closed Path Law Group. He's meeting with Sink Law's CMO about a software play that gets into all law firms. He doesn't need Davis. And Davis can't build what Danny is building even if he wanted to.

He showed Davis the opportunity. Davis built the strategy. The trade was fair. Both people are ready to run — in genuinely different directions, with genuinely different visions, toward genuinely different companies.

Start with his wins. End with the handshake.

And then go build Second Chair.

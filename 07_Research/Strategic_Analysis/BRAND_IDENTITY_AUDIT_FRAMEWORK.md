# Brand Identity Audit Framework

**Purpose:** Post-website transformation brand refinement  
**Timing:** Execute after website is performing and positioning is validated  
**Estimated Duration:** 1-3 weeks (condensed sprint approach)  
**Goal:** Perfect brand identity alignment with positioning, create visual cohesion across brand family

---

## When to Execute This Audit

**Prerequisites:**
1. ✅ Website transformation complete (Phases 1-3 minimum)
2. ✅ Initial performance metrics validating positioning (2-4 weeks of data)

## Phase 1: Name & Positioning Refinement

### Current State

5. What's the SEO/brand equity cost of changing?

**Positioning Validation:**
1. Does current positioning resonate with target attorneys?
2. Are we differentiating clearly from Martindale-Avvo, Ngage, aggregators?

## Phase 2: Visual Identity System Enhancement

### Current State Assessment

**From BRAND_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md:**
- **Colors:** Black (#0A0A0A), Gray (#666666), Green (#10B77F)
- **Typography:** Inter (800 weight headlines, 400 weight body)
- **Design Philosophy:** Confidence through simplicity, premium through restraint

### Refinement Goals

**1. Color System Enhancement**

**Current:** Black, gray, green (minimal palette)

**Questions:**
- Does green (#10B77F) feel premium enough?
- Should we integrate blue (tech-forward signal mentioned in notes)?
- How do we create cohesion with Claim Justice Now brand?
- Do we need expanded palette for diagrams/data viz?

**Exploration:**
```
Option A: Enhanced Current
- Primary: Black (#0A0A0A) — authority
- Secondary: Deeper Green (#0D9A68) — premium signal
- Accent: Subtle Blue (#1E40AF) — tech credibility
- Neutrals: Expanded gray scale

Option B: Blue Integration
- Primary: Black (#0A0A0A) — authority
- Secondary: Deep Blue (#1E40AF) — law + tech
- Accent: Green (#10B77F) — growth/success
- Neutrals: Gray scale

Option C: Dual System
- Second Chair: Black + Deep Blue (law + tech)
- Claim Justice Now: Black + Green (consumer trust)
- Shared: Black base, similar stroke styles
```

**2. Typography Refinement**

**Current:** Inter (clean, modern, tech-forward)

**Questions:**
- Does Inter fully capture "tech-forward but law" positioning?
- Should headline and Claim Justice Now use matching stroke styles?
- Do we need serif option for credibility in certain contexts?

**Exploration:**
- Maintain Inter for digital (proven, performing)
- Consider serif pairing for print/credentials
- Match stroke weights between Second Chair and Claim Justice Now wordmarks

**3. Visual Language Development**

**Elements to Define:**
- Custom iconography system (not generic stock icons)
- Diagram templates for explaining complex concepts

## Phase 3: Brand Family Architecture

### Current Brand Relationships

- Premium, exclusive, tech-forward

**Child Brands:**
1. **Claim Justice Now** — B2C case estimator (free tool)
2. **CaseSnapshot** — Consumer intake/qualification tool

**Current Issue:** Visual cohesion not fully established

### Cohesion Strategy

**From notes:**
> "I like how these use same blue and similar creative direction but different. We can match the fonts even on the name too and have the claim justice now more resemble the stroke and style of second chair so it makes sense"

**Visual DNA to Share:**
- Consistent color from palette (e.g., both use same blue/green)
- Matching stroke styles in wordmarks
- Similar typography approach (same font family or complementary pairing)
- Shared icon style
- Consistent diagram aesthetic

**Differentiation to Maintain:**
- Second Chair: Professional, premium, B2B tone
- Claim Justice Now: Accessible, clear, consumer-friendly tone
- Different applications while same family

### Brand Architecture Options

**Option A: Branded House**
- Second Chair master brand
- "Claim Justice Now by Second Chair"
- "CaseSnapshot by Second Chair"
- Strong parent brand visibility

**Option B: House of Brands**
- Three distinct brands with shared DNA
- Subtle connection, not explicit
- Flexibility for independent growth

**Option C: Hybrid Endorsement**
- Claim Justice Now (independent identity)
- "Powered by Second Chair" endorsement
- Best of both: independence + credibility

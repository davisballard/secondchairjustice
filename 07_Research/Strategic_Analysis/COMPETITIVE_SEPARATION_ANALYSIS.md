# Competitive Separation Analysis: Second Chair vs. Lead Faucet

**Date:** February 20, 2026  
**Purpose:** Honest assessment of overlap, differentiation, and risk between Second Chair and Lead Faucet  
**For:** Internal co-founder reference only

---

## Executive Summary

Davis Ballard is departing Lead Faucet and launching Second Chair with new co-founders Alex DuBelko and Sasha Zinshtein. This document provides an honest assessment of what Davis created vs. what was Danny's, where the businesses overlap, and what risks exist. The bottom line: no agreement was signed, the strategic and creative work was Davis's independent contribution, and Second Chair has removed all of Danny's tool/product IP and specific client relationships.

---

## I. What Is Clearly Davis's Work (No Conflict)

These are contributions Davis made independently. They represent Davis's skills, frameworks, and creative output — not proprietary Lead Faucet IP.

**Strategic & Creative:**
- The MVA-focused lead gen approach and methodology
- All brand positioning, messaging frameworks, and strategic architecture
- **"Claim Justice Now"** consumer brand concept — Davis conceived this
- All behavioral science integration (Richard Shotton biases, Adam Ferrier action spurs, Julian Cole comms planning)
- Every campaign concept, ad script, and visual direction
- All ad creative (Meta, Google, TikTok, Snapchat, LinkedIn)
- The AI-powered marketing engine and agency simulation system
- All research: 4 C's framework, audience psychology, B2B strategy research, persona development (Danish Graves Esquire)
- Quiz flow optimization and question architecture
- Email copy, website copy, content strategy

**Business Strategy:**
- B2B attorney acquisition strategy and sales approach
- Geo-exclusive DMA model application to PI lead gen (common industry practice; Davis shaped the specific execution)
- State/DMA market prioritization research
- Financial modeling and projection frameworks
- Competitive analysis and positioning

**Key fact:** Davis's background (18 years across Disney, Google, Samsung, Vacation, Julian Cole partnership) is what makes Second Chair's "Creative Advantage" positioning credible. This background predates Lead Faucet entirely.

## II. What Was Danny's (Removed from Second Chair)

These were Danny Dilworth's contributions to Lead Faucet. All have been stripped from Second Chair.

- **CaseSnapshot** — Proprietary AI documentation tool for MVA victims. Danny's product/UX work. Removed.
- **GetMyVisa** — Multi-language guided intake for immigration. Danny's product. Removed.
- **"Case-Ready Leads"** — Coined phrase built on top of Danny's tools as proof points. Removed.
- **UX/UI product design approach** — Danny's background and methodology. Not relevant to Second Chair.
- **$300 lead pricing** — Danny wanted to sell at industry standard $300. Second Chair charges $400 because our creative produces higher-quality, higher-intent leads.
- **Specific client relationships** — Jacoby & Meyers and Think Law were Danny's relationships. Removed from Second Chair entirely.
- **Immigration law vertical** — Danny's direction. Removed.
- **Mass tort vertical** — Danny's direction. Removed.
- **LeadFaucet.co website** — Danny's design and build. Second Chair will build its own website (Alex DuBelko).

## III. Overlap Zones — Honest Assessment

### A. PI Lead Generation (The Vertical)

**Overlap:** Both companies operate in PI lead generation.

**Why it's not a problem:**
- PI lead gen is a massive industry ($10B+ annually). Hundreds of companies compete here.
- There is no proprietary claim on "generating PI leads." This is like saying two restaurants compete because they both serve food.
- The industry includes mass players (All Injury Lawyers, Morgan & Morgan, Sokolove Law) and hundreds of smaller operations.

### B. Geo-Exclusive DMA Model

**Overlap:** Both use geo-exclusivity (one firm per territory).

**Why it's not a problem:**
- Geo-exclusivity is a common industry practice used by multiple lead gen companies (Martindale-Avvo, FindLaw, Legal Brand Marketing, etc.)
- The DMA (Designated Market Area) framework is a Nielsen standard used across all media buying — it's not proprietary.
- Multiple competitors already offer "exclusive territory" arrangements. See: COMPETITOR_GEO_EXCLUSIVITY_ANALYSIS.md.

### C. Geo-Targeting Approach

**Overlap:** Danny wanted geo-targeting. Davis conceived the specific MVA application.

**Key distinction:**
- Danny wanted to do geo-targeting as a general concept.
- Davis developed the specific methodology: which DMAs, how to target, what creative to run, how to position it to attorneys, the MVA-specific funnel architecture.
- The creative execution, targeting strategy, and conversion methodology are Davis's work.

### D. MVA Focus

**Overlap:** Both focus on MVA (Motor Vehicle Accident) cases.

**Why it's not a problem:**
- MVA is the single largest PI case category. Nearly every PI lead gen company includes MVA.
- Davis came up with the MVA-first approach and the full case spectrum strategy (soft tissue through trucking/rideshare/spine).
- The differentiation isn't "what cases" — it's "how we generate and qualify leads" (creative advantage vs. tool-based).

## IV. Key Facts for the Record

1. **No non-compete or agreement was signed.** Davis was never an employee with a contract restricting future work.
2. **All strategic and creative work was Davis's independent contribution.** This is documented across hundreds of files in the agency simulation system.
3. **Danny's contributions (tools, UX, specific client relationships) have been fully removed** from Second Chair.
4. **Second Chair charges $400/lead vs. Danny's $300/lead.** Different price point, different value proposition.
5. **Alex DuBelko brings capabilities Danny never had:** full-stack development, 0-to-1 product builds at scale (TradeStation), AI agent platform building, Reforge-level product strategy. The product roadmap will diverge significantly.
6. **Davis's advertising background (18 years, Fortune 500) predates Lead Faucet** and is not Lead Faucet IP.

## V. Should Second Chair Be MVA-Only?

This is the question of whether narrowing to only MVA cases (excluding trucking, rideshare, spine, etc.) reduces overlap risk and strengthens positioning.

### Argument FOR MVA-Only

- **Cleaner differentiation:** If Lead Faucet expands into trucking/rideshare/spine specifically, MVA-only would create clear separation.
- **Simpler operations:** One case type = simpler targeting, simpler compliance, simpler creative.
- **Faster to launch:** Less complexity, faster time to first revenue.

### Argument AGAINST MVA-Only

- **Limits revenue ceiling:** Soft tissue MVA cases average ~$17,500. Trucking cases average $100K-$1M+. The high-value cases are where the real money is.
- **Standard industry practice:** Every PI lead gen company in the country offers the full case spectrum. This is not unique to Lead Faucet.
- **Attorney partners expect it:** PI firms handle the full spectrum. They'd rather buy from one source for all case types than fragment across vendors.
- **Creative advantage applies across case types:** The same skills that make great MVA ads make great trucking/rideshare/spine ads.

### Recommendation

**Lead with MVA as the bread-and-butter, keep the full PI case spectrum.** 

The full case spectrum (soft tissue + trucking + rideshare + spine + wrongful death) is what every PI lead gen company offers. Restricting to MVA-only would actually look unusual and weaken Second Chair's positioning with attorney prospects.

The differentiation is not "what cases we generate" — it's "how we generate them" (The Creative Advantage). That's where Second Chair separates from Lead Faucet and everyone else.

## VI. Pricing Differentiation

| Factor | Lead Faucet (Danny) | Second Chair |
|---|---|---|
| **Lead Price** | $300/lead | **$400/lead** |
| **Rationale** | Industry standard pricing | Premium pricing justified by higher-quality creative producing higher-intent leads |
| **Value Proposition** | Tool-based pre-qualification (CaseSnapshot) | Creative-based pre-qualification (behavioral targeting, quiz funnels, Claim Justice Now brand) |
| **Positioning** | "We give you documented cases" | "We give you people who are already fired up and ready to sign" |

The $100/lead price difference is significant. It signals a different market position: Second Chair is not competing on price, it's competing on lead quality driven by creative quality.

---

## VII. Alex DuBelko vs. Danny Dilworth — Different Capabilities, Different Products

Danny's background: UX/UI designer, product designer, 15 years of visual design.

Alex's background: Senior Product Manager (TradeStation), full-stack web developer (General Assembly), Reforge 4x alum, CXL-certified in conversion optimization, private equity analyst (Breakwater), built AI agent trading platform.

**What this means for Second Chair:**
- Alex will build a fundamentally different product stack than Danny would have built
- TradeStation-grade reliability and scale (99.96% crash-free sessions)
- Financial modeling and ROI tools for attorneys (Breakwater PE background)
- AI-agent-powered internal tools (recent Claude Code platform build)
- CRM architecture and lead scoring systems (Alfred Realty MarTech stack experience)
- Conversion optimization infrastructure (CXL + Reforge training)

The product roadmap diverges immediately. Danny builds UX-beautiful consumer tools. Alex builds data-driven product systems with growth engineering and financial modeling baked in.

## VIII. Summary of Separation

| Dimension | Lead Faucet | Second Chair |
|---|---|---|
| **Founder** | Danny Dilworth | Davis Ballard, Alex DuBelko, Sasha Zinshtein |
| **Differentiator** | Pre-qualification tools (CaseSnapshot, GetMyVisa) | Creative Advantage (agency-grade advertising) |
| **Lead Price** | $300 | $400 |
| **Verticals** | PI, Immigration, Mass Tort | PI only |
| **Consumer Brand** | N/A (uses CaseSnapshot as consumer touchpoint) | Claim Justice Now |
| **Product Person** | Danny (UX/UI designer) | Alex (Product Manager, full-stack dev, Reforge alum) |
| **Creative Person** | Davis (was at Lead Faucet, now gone) | Davis (co-founder) |
| **Sales/Media** | Sasha (was at Lead Faucet, now gone) | Sasha (co-founder) |
| **Clients** | Jacoby & Meyers, Think Law | Starting fresh — no legacy clients |
| **Territory Model** | Geo-exclusive (state-level for some) | Geo-exclusive (DMA standard, no exceptions) |
| **Positioning** | "Case-Ready Leads" | "The Creative Advantage" |

---

## IX. What Lead Faucet Loses

For the record: Lead Faucet loses its entire strategic/creative department (Davis) and its entire sales/media buying operation (Sasha) when both leave. What remains is Danny's UX/UI capability and client relationships. Lead Faucet will need to rebuild creative, strategy, sales, and media buying from scratch.

Second Chair starts with the team that was doing all the actual execution at Lead Faucet, minus the tools and specific clients.

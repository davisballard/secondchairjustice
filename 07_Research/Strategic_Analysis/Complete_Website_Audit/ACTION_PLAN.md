## Tools & Workflow

### Primary Tool: Lovable (95% of work)

**Use Lovable for:**
- All structural changes (CSS, layouts, components)
- All copy changes (headlines, body text, CTAs)
- New sections and components
- Mobile responsiveness
- Everything except territory map (that's Danny's custom build)

**Workflow:**
1. Alignment call to decide approach for each phase
2. Implement according to approach decided
3. Test constantly (mobile-first)
4. Review quality together
5. Iterate as needed
6. Move to next change

**Note:** Danny is the Lovable/Framer expert (has been doing all the work with these tools). Prompts in `08_Lovable_Prompts.md` are references. Workflow assignments decided on alignment calls.

### Secondary Tool: Framer (5% polish only)

**Use Framer ONLY for:**
- Final micro-interactions (if needed)
- Hover state fine-tuning (if needed)
- Animation easing curves (if needed)

**Rule:** Don't use Framer for copy or structure. That's all Lovable.

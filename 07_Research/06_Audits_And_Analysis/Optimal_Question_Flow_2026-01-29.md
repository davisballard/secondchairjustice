## THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND THE ORDER

| Principle | Source | Application |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Foot-in-the-Door** | Cialdini, Freedman & Fraser | Start with easiest question (everyone says yes) |
| **Sunk Cost Fallacy** | Kahneman & Tversky | Each answer increases commitment to finish |
| **Sensitivity Gradient** | Luke Wroblewski | Low → High sensitivity questions in order |
| **Disqualifier Last** | Lead Gen Playbook | Maximum investment before potential rejection |
| **Loss Aversion** | Prospect Theory | Loading screen creates fear of losing the "result" |
| **Value Exchange Frame** | Form Design Mastery | Contact info framed as receiving, not giving |
| **Goal Gradient Effect** | Hull, 1932 | People accelerate as they approach the goal |

## COMPARISON: CURRENT VS. OPTIMAL

### Current California Flow (5 Questions)
1. Injury (Yes/No) — Direct qualifier
2. Timing (4 options)
3. Fault (3 options)
4. Medical care (3 options)
5. Attorney (3 options)

### Current Nevada Flow (6 Questions)
1. Engagement ("What are you hoping to figure out?") — Soft entry
2. Injury (Yes/No)
3. Timing (4 options)
4. Fault (3 options)
5. Medical care (3 options)
6. Attorney (3 options)

### Optimal Flow (6 Questions)
1. **Easy Win** — Soft entry + qualification combined
2. **Recency** — Low sensitivity, filters SOL
3. **Injury** — Medium sensitivity, validates pain
4. **Medical Care** — Case strength indicator
5. **Fault** — Higher sensitivity, asked after investment
6. **Attorney** — Disqualifier at maximum sunk cost

## THE OPTIMAL 6-QUESTION FLOW

---

### QUESTION 1: The Easy Win (Engagement + Soft Qualifier)

**Primary Option:**

> **"Were you recently in a car accident in [State]?"**
> 
> - ✅ Yes, within the last 2 years
> - ❌ No

**Why This Works:**
- Everyone in your target audience clicks "Yes"
- Combines engagement (easy entry) with qualification (recency)
- No wrong answer anxiety — just "yes" or "no"
- State mention creates local relevance (Cocktail Party Effect)
- Binary choice = fastest possible completion

**Alternative Option (softer, more empathetic):**

> **"Are you trying to figure out your next steps after a car accident?"**
> 
> - ✅ Yes, I need guidance
> - ❌ No, I'm all set

**When to Use Alternative:**
- If testing shows high bounce on primary option
- For warmer audiences (retargeting)
- For states with softer tone preferences

**Progress Bar:** 1 of 6 filled

**Micro-copy after selection:** None needed — auto-advance

---

### QUESTION 2: The Recency Check (Low Sensitivity)

> **"When did your accident happen?"**
> 
> - Within the last 30 days
> - Within the last 3 months
> - Within the last year
> - Over a year ago

**Why This Position:**
- Time-based question = low emotional load
- Doesn't ask about fault or injuries yet (saves sensitive questions for later)
- Filters out SOL-expired cases early
- Easy to answer (they know approximately when it happened)

**Progress Bar:** 2 of 6 filled

**Micro-copy after selection:** "Great — keep going!"

**Conditional Logic:**
- "Over a year ago" → Consider soft warning about statute of limitations, but continue flow

---

### QUESTION 3: The Injury Check (Medium Sensitivity)

> **"Have you experienced any pain or discomfort since the accident?"**
> 
> - ✅ Yes, I've had pain or symptoms
> - ⏳ Not yet, but I'm concerned
> - ❌ No, I feel fine

**Why This Position:**
- Personal but expected question (they know you need to ask)
- 3 options captures the "worried but not sure" segment
- Validates their pain without requiring specific details yet
- Follows recency naturally (when → what happened)

**Progress Bar:** 3 of 6 filled (halfway celebration)

**Micro-copy after "Yes":** "We're sorry to hear that. Let's see how we can help."

**Micro-copy after "Not yet, but I'm concerned":** "That's valid — symptoms often appear days or weeks later."

**Conditional Logic:**
- "No, I feel fine" → Soft disqualification or property-damage-only path

---

### QUESTION 4: The Medical Care Check (Medium-High Sensitivity)

> **"Have you seen a doctor since the accident?"**
> 
> - ✅ Yes, I've received medical care
> - ⏳ Not yet, but I'm planning to
> - ❌ No, I haven't

**Why This Position:**
- Follows naturally from injury question (pain → treatment)
- Indicates case strength for intake team
- "Planning to" option keeps undecided leads in funnel
- Sets up expectation that medical care matters

**Progress Bar:** 4 of 6 filled

**Micro-copy after "Yes":** "Good — medical records strengthen your case."

**Conditional Content (if "No, I haven't"):**

### QUESTION 5: The Fault Check (Higher Sensitivity — With Reassurance)

> **"Who was at fault in the accident?"**
> 
> - The other driver was at fault
> - I may have been partly at fault
> - I'm not sure yet

**Why This Position:**
- Most sensitive qualifying question = asked after significant investment
- 4 questions of sunk cost before this
- "Partly at fault" wording acknowledges reality without hard disqualification
- "I'm not sure" captures uncertain leads who may still qualify

**Progress Bar:** 5 of 6 filled — "Almost there!"

**Conditional Content (if "I'm not sure" or "Partly at fault"):**

│  🤔 Not sure who was at fault? That's completely normal.    │
│                                                              │
│  Many accidents involve shared circumstances — and          │
│  [State]'s "comparative negligence" law means you may       │
│  still qualify for compensation.                            │
│                                                              │
│  ✓ Police reports often determine fault differently         │
│    than you'd expect                                        │
│                                                              │

│                                                              │
│  ✓ Even partial fault can still mean money owed to you      │
│                                                              │

```

**Why This Reassurance Matters (from Audience Psychology Insights):**
> "You're wondering if it was your fault. They're counting on that doubt."

---

### QUESTION 6: The Attorney Disqualifier (Maximum Sunk Cost)

> **"Do you currently have an attorney for this accident?"**
> 
> - ❌ No, I don't have one yet
> - 🔍 No, but I'm looking for one
> - ✅ Yes, I already have an attorney

**Why LAST:**
- 5 questions of investment before asking this disqualifier
- If they've come this far, they're highly committed
- "Looking for one" is your highest-intent segment — flag these leads
- Placing disqualifiers early = wasted sunk cost psychology

**Progress Bar:** 6 of 6 filled — "Last question!"

**Micro-copy after "No, I don't have one yet":** "Perfect — we can help."

**Micro-copy after "Looking for one":** "You're in the right place."

**Conditional Content (if "Yes, I already have"):**

**Why Soft Exit:**
- Captures email for future nurture
- Respectful exit builds brand goodwill
- Reduces junk leads in intake queue
- They may refer others or return for future cases

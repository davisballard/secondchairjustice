## Unified Recommendations by Website Section

### Hero Section

**What All Experts Agree On:**
1. Mobile H1 is too large (102.4px → 56-64px)
2. CTA must be above fold on mobile
3. Proof bar creates noise (static grid > scrolling)
4. Copy should translate to human language
5. Need visual signature device (territory map)

**Integrated Fix:**
```
OPTIMIZED HERO SECTION

[Reduced H1: 56px mobile]
"We don't just sell leads."

[Human language subhead]
"You own your market. Every qualified case comes to 
you—and only you. No bidding wars. Once your market 
is locked, it stays locked."

[Static proof grid 2×2]
92% acceptance | $1,600/case | 47 territories | ZERO shared

[Visible CTA above fold + sticky bar]
"See if my market is available"

[Social proof]
"Join 47 elite PI firms who've locked their markets"
```

**Expected Combined Impact:** +40-55% mobile conversion

---

### Geo-Exclusive Section

**What All Experts Agree On:**
1. This is the core differentiation (protect it)
2. "Territory" concept begs for visualization
3. Needs competitive context
4. Scarcity should be tangible, not abstract
5. This should be the brand signature

**Integrated Fix:**
```
[Territory Map Visual - Large, Prominent]
U.S. map showing:
- Green dots = 47 locked territories
- Gray outlines = available markets

Headline: "47 territories locked. Is yours still available?"

[Copy Enhancement]
"Unlike Martindale-Avvo, which sells 'exclusive' leads 
to multiple buyers, we lock one territory to one firm. 
Period."

[Emotional Close]
"Your territory. Your clients. Your fight."

CTA: "Check if my market is open"
```

**Expected Impact:** +25-35% engagement + brand memorability

---

### Four Phases (How It Works)

1. Structure works well (don't break it)
2. Could connect phases to purpose
3. Minor copy enhancements add emotional depth

**Integrated Fix:**
```
Phase 1: Build
[Current copy maintained]

advocates, not lead buyers. Firms that care about the 
mission—fighting for people—not just the margin."

        | our acceptance rate went from 40% 
        | to 91%. We finally have predictable

```

**Expected Impact:** +20-30% trust and qualified self-selection

---

### Final CTA / Limited Availability

**What All Experts Agree On:**
1. Scarcity is clear but could be more urgent
2. Need competitive urgency
3. Add "what happens next" clarity
4. CTA visual weight needs increase

**Integrated Fix:**
```
[Competitive Urgency]
"While you're reading this, another PI firm in your 
city might be signing cases that should have been yours. 
We have 47 territories locked. Some of the best markets—
Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix—are gone."

[Mission Connection]
"If your market is still available, this could be the 
certainty you've been looking for. Not just more leads. 
The predictability that lets you focus on what matters: 
fighting for people who can't fight billion-dollar 
insurance companies alone."

[Enhanced CTA - Darker Green or Black]
"See if my market is available"

[What Happens Next - Below CTA]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
After you apply:
1. We review your application (24-48 hours)
2. If your market is available, we schedule a call
3. We discuss fit, capacity, and exclusivity terms
4. If aligned, you own your territory (locked)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Expected Impact:** +25-35% CTA conversion rate

**Content:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHY WE BUILT THIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Founder Photo]

"I watched solo and small PI firms get crushed by 
resource asymmetry. Brilliant advocates losing cases 
to insurance companies' billion-dollar legal teams—
not because they weren't good enough, but because 
they couldn't afford consistent pipeline.

Lead gen companies made it worse. Shared leads. 
Bidding wars. Volume quotas. Firms competing against 
each other instead of fighting for their clients.

So we built Second Chair differently. One firm per 
market. True exclusivity. Predictable case flow. 
Because your fight shouldn't be finding cases—
it should be winning them."

— [Founder Name], Founder

[Small CTA]
"See if your market is available"

## The One Thing All Experts Agree On

**TERRITORY MAP = HIGHEST PRIORITY**

Every discipline identified the territory map as critical:

- **Design (Graham):** "Visual signature device, makes site memorable"
- **UX (Luke):** "Makes abstract tangible, proves scarcity"
- **Behavioral (Adam):** "Stacks scarcity + social proof visually"
- **Creative (John):** "This is the killer idea—execute it boldly"
- **Copy (Ed):** "Visual proof supports verbal promise"

**Recommendation:** Make territory map large, prominent, and impossible to miss. This is your zag.

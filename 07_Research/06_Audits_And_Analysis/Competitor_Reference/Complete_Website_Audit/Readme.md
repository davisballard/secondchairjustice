## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Baseline (capture before changes):**
- Homepage bounce rate
- Time on page
- CTA click-through rate
- Application starts
- Application completions

**Expected improvements:**
- End of Phase 1: +35-50% mobile conversion
- End of Phase 2: +60-85% cumulative
- End of Phase 3: +80-115% cumulative (2x+)
- End of Phase 4: +105-155% cumulative (3x potential)

## 🛠 Tools Required

**Davis and Alex need:**
- Lovable access (for 95% of work: structure + copy)
- Mobile devices (for testing)
- This audit folder (for prompts and reference)
- Design tools OR React map library (for territory map - approach decided on alignment call)
- Multiple devices for cross-browser testing
- Analytics platform admin access (if doing Phase 4)

**Key Context:** Alex is Lovable/Framer expert (has been doing all the work with these tools). Workflow assignments decided on alignment calls.

**Framer (optional):**
- Only for final 5% polish (micro-interactions)
- NOT for copy or structure changes

---

## 📞 Pre-Implementation Sync

**Before starting, discuss together:**
- [ ] Do we have Lovable access?
- [ ] Territory map approach: React library or custom design?
- [ ] Which partner firms for testimonials?
- [ ] **Who tackles what? Decide workflow on alignment call**
- [ ] Can we work 10-12+ hrs/day together (potentially 16 hrs combined first few days)?
- [ ] Starting today (Thursday) or next session?

**Recommended:** 30-minute sync to align on phases 1-3

## ✅ Next Action

**Implementation team should:**

1. Open `START_HERE.md` (review together)
2. Open `ACTION_PLAN.md` (review Phase 1 approach)
3. Start Phase 1 alignment call
4. **Decide approach together: Who tackles what?**
5. Begin implementing according to approach decided

**Goal:** Complete Phase 1 (10-12 hours)  
**Result:** +35-50% mobile conversion rate

## Hero Section

### H1
> **"We don't just generate demand. We build the tools that capture it."**

🟠 **STRUCTURAL** — Variation on the "we don't just sell leads" framing pattern. The "generate demand / capture it" language echoes the Demand Creation / Demand Capture phase naming. The structural pattern of "we don't just [X], we [Y]" is a Lead Faucet rhetorical signature that appears in multiple places and has carried into Second Chair docs.

### Three Feature Claims

> **Intake time reduced** — "Claimants arrive pre-documented and pre-educated. Your team spends time on cases, not paperwork."

> **Lead quality amplified** — "Tools self-qualify users before they submit. What reaches your team is worth their time."

> **Geo-exclusive access** — "Partner firms get exclusive integration with these tools in their locked markets. Competitors can't replicate it."

🟡 **TONAL** — "Pre-documented and pre-educated," "self-qualify," and "worth their time" are shared category language. The geo-exclusive access framing mirrors Second Chair's positioning but is not verbatim.

## CaseSnapshot Product

### Tagline
> *"Organized. Not by accident."*

🟢 **MONITOR** — Lead Faucet's original product copy. No Second Chair overlap.

### Description
> "A free, AI-assisted tool that helps motor vehicle accident victims document their entire case in under 5 minutes. No signup required. Claimants answer guided questions, generate a professional PDF summary, and share a permalink with their attorney — maximizing the likelihood of a top-tier result."

🟢 **MONITOR** — CaseSnapshot is Lead Faucet's proprietary product. This copy has no relevance to Second Chair's approach. Second Chair does NOT build consumer-facing tools; leads are pre-qualified through creative and quiz funnels instead.

### What It Does (bullet list)
- AI-guided case documentation in under 5 minutes
- Professional PDF download and shareable permalink
- 100% private — no account needed, data stays on-device
- Dramatically reduces intake time for partner firms
- Pre-qualifies and educates claimants before they reach your team

🟢 **MONITOR** — Tool-specific feature copy. No Second Chair overlap.

## GetMyVisa Product

### Tagline
> *"Your path, simplified."*

🟢 **MONITOR** — Lead Faucet's original immigration tool copy. Second Chair does not operate in immigration.

### Description
> "A multi-language, guided intake experience for immigration applicants. Covers family petitions, employment visas, asylum, and naturalization — helping applicants organize documentation and understand eligibility before they ever speak to an attorney."

🟢 **MONITOR** — No Second Chair overlap. Immigration is not a Second Chair practice area.

### What It Does (bullet list)
- Multi-language support across 12+ visa categories
- Guided document preparation and eligibility screening
- Reduces consultation time and improves case acceptance rates

🟢 **MONITOR** — No overlap.

## Mass Tort Qualification Tool (Coming Soon)

### Description
> "A high-volume screening tool for emerging and active mass torts. Claimants self-qualify through guided questioning that validates exposure, injury, and eligibility — filtering out non-viable claims before they consume firm resources."

🟢 **MONITOR** — Coming-soon product. No Second Chair overlap.

---

## Section Closing

### H2
> **"Infrastructure your competitors can't buy."**

🟠 **STRUCTURAL** — "Infrastructure" as the core positioning word is shared with Second Chair's "demand infrastructure" language throughout `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`. The concept of competitive inaccessibility ("can't buy") echoes Second Chair's exclusivity framing.

### Body
> "These tools are built in-house and deployed exclusively to partner firms. They aren't available on the open market. They're part of the infrastructure."

🟡 **TONAL** — "Part of the infrastructure" and "available on the open market" framing. The infrastructure positioning concept is shared.

### CTA
> "Apply for your market"

🔴 **VERBATIM** — "Apply for your market" is a direct geo-exclusivity CTA that triggers the scarcity pressure Davis wants to move away from. Appears in multiple Lead Faucet pages.

## Key Observations — Products Page

**Second Chair does NOT build consumer tools.** This page's primary content — CaseSnapshot and GetMyVisa — is entirely Lead Faucet's intellectual property and strategy. Second Chair's qualification mechanism is different: creative that pre-programs intent + quiz funnels that pre-qualify through engagement, rather than documentation tools that qualify after the fact.

This distinction is actually a clean differentiator Second Chair can use:
- Lead Faucet qualifies AFTER interest is expressed (tools, documentation)
- Second Chair qualifies BEFORE interest is expressed (creative pre-programs who clicks)

The products page is therefore low risk for verbatim overlap but useful for understanding how Lead Faucet positions its unique mechanism — which Second Chair should explicitly contrast against when writing its own "how it works" content.

## Summary: Products Page Severity Count

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| 🔴 VERBATIM | 1 |
| 🟠 STRUCTURAL | 2 |
| 🟡 TONAL | 2 |
| 🟢 MONITOR | 8 |

**Lower overlap than homepage.** The products are Lead Faucet-specific. The framing patterns ("infrastructure," "apply for your market") are the main concerns.

# Lead Faucet Language Audit — Index

**Date:** February 28, 2026

**Purpose:** Protect Second Chair from plagiarism exposure and build differentiated language from the ground up
**Status:** Complete — All live pages audited as of February 28, 2026

## Why This Exists

Davis Ballard contributed significant creative and strategic work to Lead Faucet prior to founding Second Chair. During that period, Second Chair's early brand positioning was developed in parallel — and some of that language was drawn from or informed by Lead Faucet's live website copy.

This audit documents every page of the Lead Faucet website — verbatim copy, structural patterns, key phrases, and positioning language — so that Second Chair can:

1. Identify exactly which language in its existing brand documents mirrors Lead Faucet
2. Replace that language with original Second Chair positioning
3. Maintain a clean reference for future copywriting that avoids accidental replication

**The definitive output is `07_DO_NOT_REPLICATE.md`.** Everything else is supporting evidence for that list.

## Severity Ratings Used Throughout Audit

Each flagged phrase or pattern is rated for severity of overlap risk:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🔴 **VERBATIM** | Exact phrase appears word-for-word in existing Second Chair documents — immediate scrub required |
| 🟠 **STRUCTURAL** | Same conceptual framework or structural pattern, even if words differ — rephrase or restructure |
| 🟡 **TONAL** | Same category language, tone cluster, or positioning claim — review and differentiate |
| 🟢 **MONITOR** | Industry-standard language that both companies will naturally use — acceptable, but watch density |

## Quick Summary: The Most Critical Overlaps

These are the highest-priority items. All appear verbatim in both Lead Faucet's live site and Second Chair's existing brand documents:

1. `"We don't just sell leads."` — Lead Faucet H1 / Second Chair `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` opening line
2. `"One firm per market. No exceptions."` — Identical in both
3. Four-phase system: **Demand Creation / Demand Capture / Demand Qualification / Delivery and Trust** — identical in both
4. `"Over-qualification beats volume"` — identical in both
5. `"Operational dependency, not vendor dependency"` — identical in both
6. `"We don't work with every firm"` — identical in both
7. `"Bad weeks reported early. No surprises."` — identical in both
8. `"Trust before transaction"` — identical in both
9. Social proof metrics: **92% qualification acceptance rate**, **$1,600 avg cost per signed case**, **47 exclusive territories locked** — all shared
10. `"Scarcity is strategic"` — identical in both

## What Is Safely Ownable by Second Chair

The following elements do NOT appear anywhere on Lead Faucet's site and are legitimately Second Chair's original positioning:

- **The Creative Advantage** — advertising-first lead generation powered by Fortune 500 creative experience
- **Justice framing** — "Claim Justice Now," the emotional spine around PI attorneys as justice fighters
- **The emotional layer** — attorney identity, contingency trap, resource asymmetry, pipeline anxiety as the real product
- **"The rhythm that keeps a practice alive"** — Second Chair's emotional positioning for what leads actually represent
- **The David vs. Goliath frame** — PI attorney vs. insurance companies with unlimited resources
- **"We sell certainty, not leads"** — the deeper truth framing
- **The case spectrum framework** — "Keep the Lights On" vs. "Build the Firm" case taxonomy
- **Fortune 500 advertising experience** as a differentiator
- **Quiz funnel methodology** as the engagement/qualification mechanism

## How to Use This Audit

**For the Second Chair scrub:** Read `07_DO_NOT_REPLICATE.md` first. It is the master action list. Then use the individual page files as reference if you need context around a specific phrase.

**For future copywriting:** Any Second Chair copy — website, LinkedIn, sales materials, email — should be checked against `07_DO_NOT_REPLICATE.md` before publishing.

**For competitive intelligence:** These files also serve as a record of Lead Faucet's current positioning, which informs how Second Chair can differentiate in market.

# DO NOT REPLICATE — Master Scrub List

**Date:** February 28, 2026
**Purpose:** The single action document for scrubbing Lead Faucet language from Second Chair's brand files
**Status:** Complete — ready for use in Second Chair brand document review

---

## How to Use This Document

**For scrubbing existing Second Chair files:**
Search each document for the exact phrases in Section 1. Replace with Second Chair's own language. Then check Section 2 for structural patterns to restructure. Then check Section 3 for tonal clusters to reconsider.

**For new Second Chair copy:**
Before publishing any new content, check it against all three sections. If a phrase or structure appears here, rewrite it from scratch.

**The goal is not to avoid these topics** — geo-exclusivity, qualification, compliance, and transparency are real things Second Chair will address. The goal is to address them with Second Chair's own voice and structure, not Lead Faucet's.

---

## SECTION 1: VERBATIM PHRASES — Immediate Scrub Required

These exact phrases appear on the Lead Faucet website AND in existing Second Chair documents. All must be replaced with original Second Chair language.

---

### 1A. Core Positioning Phrases

| Phrase | Lead Faucet Location | Second Chair Location | Priority |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|
| "We don't just sell leads." | Homepage H1 | `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` opening line | CRITICAL |
| "One firm per market. No exceptions." | Homepage, throughout | `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`, `LINKEDIN_COMPANY_PROFILE.md` | CRITICAL |
| "Over-qualification beats volume" | Homepage ticker | `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` | CRITICAL |
| "Demand infrastructure" | Homepage, throughout | `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` throughout | CRITICAL |
| "Scarcity is strategic" | Homepage closing | `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` | HIGH |
| "We don't work with every firm" | Homepage | `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` | HIGH |
| "We're not a lead vendor. We're demand infrastructure." | Homepage | Echoed in `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` | HIGH |

**Replacement direction for "We don't just sell leads":**
Second Chair's actual differentiation is creative-first lead generation. The opener should reflect that: "We build advertising systems, not lead pipelines." or angle into The Creative Advantage directly.

**Replacement direction for "One firm per market. No exceptions.":**
Davis's stated direction is to move away from geo-exclusivity as the primary selling point. If exclusivity is mentioned at all, it should be positioned as a byproduct of quality, not a scarcity play. Consider: "Elite firms get our full attention. That means one at a time." or drop the geo framing entirely and lead with Creative Advantage.

---

### 1B. Four-Phase System Names

The four-phase system in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` uses Lead Faucet's exact phase names:

| Lead Faucet Phase Name | Second Chair Usage | Action |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| "Demand Creation" | `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` | Rename |
| "Demand Capture" | `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` | Rename |
| "Demand Qualification" | `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` | Rename |
| "Delivery and Trust" | `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` | Rename |

**Replacement direction:**
Second Chair's four phases should reflect its advertising-first methodology. Suggested naming that emphasizes The Creative Advantage:
1. **Attract** — Agency-grade creative that pre-programs intent before anyone fills out a form
2. **Commit** — Quiz funnels that deepen engagement and surface the right people
3. **Screen** — Qualification that protects your intake team's time
4. **Prove** — Transparent data, honest reporting, and compounding ROI

Or abandon the four-phase framing entirely if it feels too close to the Lead Faucet template.

---

### 1C. Specific Phrases to Find and Replace

Search all Second Chair documents for each of the following exact strings:

- `"Trust before transaction"` → Replace with Second Chair's own language for earned trust
- `"Bad weeks reported early. No surprises."` → Replace. Second Chair can commit to transparency differently: "We report the truth, even when it's uncomfortable."
- `"Operational dependency, not vendor dependency"` → Replace. The intent is good but the phrasing is Lead Faucet's.
- `"See if we're a fit"` → Replace across all CTAs and sales materials
- `"Claim your market"` / `"Claim your market before someone else does"` → Remove entirely per Davis's strategic direction
- `"47 exclusive territories locked"` → Remove. These are Lead Faucet's metrics. Second Chair needs its own.
- `"92% qualification acceptance rate"` → Remove until Second Chair has independently verified this figure for its own leads
- `"$1,600 avg cost per signed case"` → Remove until Second Chair establishes its own CPSC benchmarks
- `"Not cost per lead"` → This framing is ownable conceptually but needs different phrasing. Try: "The metric that matters is cost per signed case, not cost per click."
- `"We reject aggressively"` → Replace. Second Chair's version: "Our creative does the filtering before the funnel does."
- `"Apply for your market"` → Replace CTA
- `"See available markets"` → Replace or remove
- `"No pitch. No pressure."` → Acceptable industry phrasing but overused on Lead Faucet; find Second Chair's own register

---

### 1D. Social Proof Metrics That Are Lead Faucet's

Do NOT use these figures in Second Chair materials until independently established:

- 92% qualification acceptance rate
- $1,600 average cost per signed case
- 47 exclusive territories locked / exclusive markets
- $400 per lead pricing (this was Lead Faucet pricing discussed internally)

**Why this matters:** These numbers originated at Lead Faucet. Using them in Second Chair materials before Second Chair has its own data either: (a) copies Lead Faucet's proof points, or (b) makes claims Second Chair cannot yet back up. Both are problems.

---

### 1E. "Who We Work With / Don't Work With" List

The following list appears nearly verbatim in both Lead Faucet's site and Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`:

**Lead Faucet (homepage):**
- "We partner with firms that: Already invest in lead generation / Have intake infrastructure in place / Want predictability over hype / Accept geo-exclusivity terms / Think in terms of cost per signed case, not cost per lead"
- "We don't work with: Price shoppers looking for the cheapest CPL / Firms without intake discipline / Anyone who treats leads as a commodity"

**Action:** Rewrite the Second Chair partner criteria entirely. The underlying intent (we're selective, we work with serious firms) is right. The execution must be Second Chair's own. Lead with what Second Chair believes, not what it excludes.

---

## SECTION 2: STRUCTURAL PATTERNS TO AVOID

These are Lead Faucet's structural fingerprints — the architectural patterns used throughout their site. Even with different words, these structures will feel derivative if replicated directly.

---

### 2A. "We don't just [X]. We [Y]." Sentence Construction

Lead Faucet uses this construction repeatedly:
- "We don't just sell leads."
- "We don't just generate demand. We build the tools that capture it."
- "We don't run ads. We occupy attention."

Second Chair's documents use variations of this construction. It's a rhetorical signature that needs to be retired. Second Chair should lead with what it IS, not what it's not.

---

### 2B. The "Status Quo vs. Us" Two-Column Comparison Table

Lead Faucet uses this table on every practice area page with the header: "What you're dealing with now vs. what we do differently."

Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` includes a version of this table (Competitors vs. Second Chair). The two-column format is not ownable, but the headers and framing are Lead Faucet's. If Second Chair uses a comparison table, it should use different headers and different information hierarchy.

---

### 2C. The Four-Step Process with "Find / Engage / Screen / Deliver" Logic

Lead Faucet's four steps (Find them / Engage them / Screen them / Deliver & prove) appear across all practice area pages with near-identical copy. Second Chair's four-phase system (Demand Creation / Demand Capture / Demand Qualification / Delivery and Trust) maps exactly onto this structure.

Second Chair needs a different process framework — one that centers creative and advertising rather than find/screen/deliver logic.

---

### 2D. The "What Would Better [X] Be Worth to Your Firm?" Calculator Frame

Lead Faucet uses a revenue calculator on every practice area page with "The waste you're carrying" / "With Lead Faucet infrastructure" framing. The before/after calculator concept is not ownable, but the "waste" labeling and "infrastructure" framing are Lead Faucet's.

If Second Chair builds a calculator, use different framing. The "waste" angle is also pessimistic — Second Chair's positioning could anchor on opportunity instead: "What your firm could be signing."

---

### 2E. The "No Pitch. No Pressure." Closing CTA Pattern

Lead Faucet ends every practice area page with a low-pressure CTA: "No pitch. No pressure. Just math." or "No pitch, no pressure — just a quick conversation to see if we're a fit."

Second Chair's closing CTAs should not replicate this structure. A different approach: make the ask specific and confident rather than minimizing ("Let's look at your market together." or "Show us what you're working with.").

---

### 2F. The Scarcity/Urgency Closing on the Homepage

"Claim your market before someone else does. Once a geography is locked to a partner, it stays locked."

Davis has explicitly said this urgency model is not right for Second Chair's high-end attorney audience. Do not replicate it. Second Chair's version of scarcity, if used at all, should come from genuine capacity limits ("We run a focused number of campaigns simultaneously. That's intentional."), not geo-territory pressure.

---

### 2G. "The Longer We Work Together, the More the Data Proves We're Worth It"

This phrase appears identically on three Lead Faucet practice area pages. It's a closing proof statement about compounding data value. While the concept is true and worth expressing for Second Chair, this exact construction belongs to Lead Faucet. Find a different way to say it.

---

## SECTION 3: TONAL CLUSTERS TO REVIEW

These are language territories where Second Chair and Lead Faucet overlap in tone and direction. No immediate scrub required, but these areas need differentiated expression.

---

### 3A. Compliance Language

Both companies use: SB 37, TCPA, 1-to-1 consent, chain of custody, MDL-ready documentation.

These are regulatory terms — neither company owns them. However, Second Chair's compliance framing should be expressed differently. Lead Faucet leads with compliance as a "competitive advantage." Second Chair might frame it as a baseline minimum: "Every lead arrives clean. That's not a differentiator — it's the floor."

---

### 3B. "By the Time They Reach Your Team, They're [Ready / Serious / Qualified]" Phrasing

Lead Faucet uses this formula across every page:
- "By the time someone reaches intake, they're calm, qualified, and ready."
- "By the time they reach your team, they're serious."
- "By the time they reach your team, they're informed and ready."

This outcome framing — describing the lead state at point of delivery — is something Second Chair also needs to express. But the formula itself is Lead Faucet's. Second Chair should develop its own language for describing lead readiness. The creative angle offers a different entry point: "Our ads attract people who are already halfway there."

---

### 3C. "Cost Per Signed Case, Not Cost Per Lead" Metric Reframe

This is the most important metric reframe in the category, and it's one both companies use. The CPSC-vs-CPL distinction is not ownable — it's an industry-wide shift in how sophisticated buyers think. However, the exact phrasing "Not cost per lead. [X] is the metric that actually matters." is Lead Faucet's construction.

Second Chair can own this territory with different language. The creative angle provides a unique entry: "CPL rewards volume. CPSC rewards quality. Our creative is the reason our CPSC beats the category."

---

### 3D. "Most Vendors" as the Competitive Foil

Both companies position competitors as "most vendors" who do things wrong. This is a shared rhetorical posture. Lead Faucet: "Most vendors send you a spreadsheet and call it reporting." Second Chair: "Most lead gen companies run template ads."

The "most vendors" framing is fine and natural. The specific constructions should not mirror Lead Faucet's. Second Chair's competitive differentiation should focus on the creative dimension — which is genuinely original territory Lead Faucet does not occupy.

---

### 3E. "Intake Team" as the Protected Resource

Both companies frame their qualification work as protecting "your intake team's time." This is accurate and useful framing. The concept is industry-standard. Vary the language: "your team," "the people who pick up the phone," "intake," etc.

---

## SECTION 4: WHAT IS SAFELY SECOND CHAIR'S OWN

The following elements do NOT appear anywhere on Lead Faucet's site and are legitimately Second Chair's original IP. These are the building blocks of differentiated positioning.

---

### 4A. The Creative Advantage

The concept of advertising-first lead generation — using agency-grade creative to pre-program intent before anyone fills out a form — is absent from Lead Faucet's positioning entirely. Lead Faucet qualifies after interest is expressed (via documentation tools). Second Chair qualifies before interest is expressed (via creative).

**This is Second Chair's primary differentiator. Lead with it.**

Phrases safely owned by Second Chair:
- "The Creative Advantage"
- "Agency-grade creative at lead-gen prices"
- "18+ years of Fortune 500 advertising experience applied to legal lead generation"
- "Pre-programs intent before a prospect ever picks up the phone"
- "Better ads attract better people"
- "Creative-led demand generation"

---

### 4B. Justice Framing

The entire "Claim Justice Now" positioning — justice as the emotional frame for PI lead generation — does not appear anywhere on Lead Faucet's site. Lead Faucet's positioning is rational and process-focused. Second Chair's emotional layer (justice, the fight, attorney identity) is original territory.

Phrases safely owned by Second Chair:
- "Claim Justice Now" (consumer brand)
- Justice framing across all consumer-facing creative
- "What PI attorneys do every day is fight for justice"
- "Leads who arrive already believing in the fight"
- "You became a PI attorney to fight for people, not to manage spreadsheets"

---

### 4C. Attorney Identity and Emotional Layer

Lead Faucet's site is almost entirely rational. It speaks to attorneys as buyers and operators. It does not speak to who attorneys are, what they carry, or why they chose this work.

Everything in Second Chair's emotional layer is original:
- The contingency trap (all the risk is on the attorney)
- Pipeline anxiety as the actual product being solved
- "We sell certainty, not leads"
- "The rhythm that keeps a practice alive"
- The David vs. Goliath framing (PI attorney vs. insurance companies with unlimited resources)
- "You can't talk to your staff or your spouse about what you're carrying"
- Resource asymmetry as the enemy

---

### 4D. Case Spectrum Framework

The "Keep the Lights On" / "Build the Firm" taxonomy for PI case types is Second Chair's original framing. Lead Faucet categorizes case types by practice area (MVA, slip and fall, etc.) but does not frame them by their role in a firm's financial health.

This taxonomy is safely Second Chair's own.

---

### 4E. "We Build Advertising Systems" as the Core Claim

Lead Faucet says: "We build tools that people actually use when they need a lawyer."
Second Chair says: "We build advertising systems that pre-program intent."

These are genuinely different claims about genuinely different approaches. Second Chair's creative-systems framing is original and should be the lead.

---

## SECTION 5: SECOND CHAIR FILES TO REVIEW AGAINST THIS LIST

The following files have the highest concentration of Lead Faucet language and should be prioritized in the scrub:

| File | Risk Level | Primary Issues |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| `01_Identity/BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` | 🔴 CRITICAL | "We don't just sell leads," four-phase system names, geo-exclusivity framing, "who we work with" list, shared metrics |
| `03_Voice/LINKEDIN_COMPANY_PROFILE.md` | 🟠 HIGH | "One firm per market. No exceptions." as standalone tagline, specialties list framing |
| `01_Identity/GEO_EXCLUSIVITY_POLICY.md` | 🟠 HIGH | Entire document built around the geo-exclusivity model Davis wants to reconsider |
| `07_Research/B2B_Strategy_Research/03_Geo_Exclusivity/` | 🟠 HIGH | Research built around a model that mirrors Lead Faucet's positioning |
| `12_Campaigns/B2B_Attorney_Acquisition/00_CENTRAL_STRATEGY/UNIVERSAL_MESSAGING_FRAMEWORK.md` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Likely uses four-phase language and geo-exclusivity framing |
| `03_Voice/AD_MESSAGING_FRAMEWORK.md` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Check for "see if we're a fit" CTAs and phase name references |

---

## SECTION 6: QUICK REFERENCE — FIND AND REPLACE MAP

For anyone doing the scrub, here is the shorthand map:

| REMOVE | REPLACE WITH |
|--------|-------------|
| "We don't just sell leads." | Lead with The Creative Advantage |
| "One firm per market. No exceptions." | Remove or rephrase around quality, not scarcity |
| "Demand Creation / Demand Capture / Demand Qualification / Delivery and Trust" | New phase names centered on creative methodology |
| "Over-qualification beats volume" | "Creative pre-qualification — the ad screens the lead before the form does" |
| "Demand infrastructure" | "Advertising system" / "creative infrastructure" / "lead generation engine" |
| "Trust before transaction" | "Earned trust before intake" or remove |
| "Bad weeks reported early. No surprises." | "We report everything, including the bad weeks. Especially the bad weeks." |
| "Operational dependency, not vendor dependency" | "A partnership that compounds — the longer we work together, the more the data earns" |
| "See if we're a fit" | "Let's talk about what you're building" / "Tell us about your firm" |
| "Claim your market" | Remove |
| "47 exclusive territories locked" | Remove until Second Chair has its own verified figure |
| "92% qualification acceptance rate" | Remove until independently verified for Second Chair leads |
| "$1,600 avg cost per signed case" | Remove until Second Chair establishes its own CPSC |
| "Scarcity is strategic" | Remove |
| "We don't work with every firm" | "We work with firms who believe creative quality is a competitive advantage" |
| "Apply for your market" | Develop Second Chair's own intake CTA |
| "No pitch. No pressure." | "We'll show you the work. You decide from there." |

# Lead Faucet — Partner Application Flow Audit

**URL:** `https://www.leadfaucet.co/partner-application`
**Captured:** February 28, 2026
**Page type:** Multi-step application / conversion flow

---

## Overview

The Lead Faucet partner application is a 6-step multi-page form that functions as their primary conversion mechanism. The page captured shows Step 1 of 6. The form gates access to the company (you must apply to become a partner), which reinforces the geo-exclusivity and selectivity positioning.

## Step 1 Copy

### Header
> **"1 of 6 — Partner application"**

### Question
> **"What area best describes your firm?"**

### Answer Options
- Personal injury
- Immigration
- Mass tort
- Other

🟢 **MONITOR** — Simple intake question. No verbatim overlap with Second Chair materials. This is standard lead capture.

## UX Pattern Observations

### Framing: Application, Not Contact Form

Lead Faucet calls this a **"partner application"** rather than a "contact form" or "get a quote" flow. This is a deliberate positioning choice that reinforces:
- Their selectivity ("we don't work with every firm")
- The exclusivity of access (you have to qualify to work with them)
- The scarcity model (territory availability is limited)

🟠 **STRUCTURAL** — Second Chair's CTA copy throughout its documents uses "see if we're a fit" language that implies the same application-gatekeeping model. The direction Davis outlined is to move away from this urgency/scarcity framing as a conversion mechanism, especially for high-end attorney buyers. The "apply to us" structure may work against the peer-level positioning Second Chair wants to establish.

### 6-Step Flow Structure

The application is 6 steps — a deliberate friction mechanism. High friction intake is a qualifier itself: firms that complete a 6-step application are self-selecting as serious buyers. This is consistent with Lead Faucet's over-qualification philosophy applied to their own sales funnel.

🟠 **STRUCTURAL** — Second Chair's landing page planning documents have referenced multi-step quiz/intake flows for B2B conversion. The 6-step structure is a Lead Faucet-specific implementation. Second Chair should develop its own intake structure that doesn't mirror this form length or framing.

### No Price Mention

The application flow asks about practice area before revealing any pricing. This is a classic sales funnel pattern — qualify the prospect before discussing economics.

🟢 **MONITOR** — Common B2B sales practice. Not a language overlap issue.

## CTA Language Across the Site (Consolidated)

The following CTAs appear repeatedly across Lead Faucet pages and point to this application:

| CTA Copy | Page(s) |
|----------|---------|
| "See if we're a fit — let's grow your firm" | Homepage (primary CTA) |
| "See if we're a fit" | Homepage (secondary), PI page |
| "Apply for your market" | Products page, immigration page |
| "See available markets" | Homepage (geo-exclusivity section) |
| "Claim your market before someone else does" | Homepage (closing section) |
| "If the numbers make sense, the next step is a 15-minute call. No pitch. No pressure." | PI page, mass tort page |

🔴 **VERBATIM** — **"See if we're a fit"** is the most critical CTA to replace. It appears in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` and in planned website copy. This is Lead Faucet's primary CTA phrasing.

🟠 **STRUCTURAL** — The overall CTA strategy (geo-urgency → scarcity → application) is a Lead Faucet pattern. Davis's stated direction is to move away from this model. Second Chair's CTA approach should reflect a different philosophy: the product sells itself, the buyer is high-end, and urgency comes from genuine quality rather than manufactured scarcity.

## Strategic Notes on the Application Model

**What Lead Faucet's application model signals:**
- Selectivity is the brand (you have to qualify to work with us)
- Scarcity is the closer (your market may already be taken)
- The application is the conversion mechanism

**What Davis wants Second Chair to signal instead:**
- The work is the brand (show the creative, the results, the intelligence)
- Quality is the closer (the economics speak for themselves)
- The relationship starts with understanding, not an application

This is a meaningful strategic departure that will require Second Chair to develop an entirely different B2B conversion architecture — one where the sales process itself reflects the premium positioning.

## Page Tagline / Navigation

> *"tap a droplet"*

**Note:** Visual/interaction gimmick tied to the "faucet" brand metaphor. Not relevant to Second Chair.

---

## Hero Section

### H1
> **"We don't just sell leads."**

🔴 **VERBATIM** — This exact phrase is the opening line of Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`. Must be replaced entirely.

### Hero Subhead
> "We build tools that people actually use when they need a lawyer — things like injury calculators and visa screeners. Those tools turn visitors into signed cases for your firm. The best part? No other firm in your area gets to use them. They're yours."

🟡 **TONAL** — The "no other firm in your area" exclusivity concept is shared industry framing. The specific tool-building angle (CaseSnapshot, GetMyVisa) is Lead Faucet's own — Second Chair does not build consumer tools, so this naturally differentiates.

### Primary CTA
> "See if we're a fit — let's grow your firm"

🔴 **VERBATIM** — "See if we're a fit" appears repeatedly in Second Chair documents and on the planned Second Chair website. This exact CTA phrasing belongs to Lead Faucet. Replace.

## Social Proof Bar (Ticker)

> Geo-exclusive accounts only · 92% qualification acceptance rate · $1,600 avg cost per signed case · One firm per market · Zero shared leads · 47 exclusive territories locked · Over-qualification beats volume

🔴 **VERBATIM** — Multiple phrases in this ticker appear verbatim in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`:
- "92% qualification acceptance rate" — shared metric
- "$1,600 avg cost per signed case" — shared metric
- "Over-qualification beats volume" — exact phrase match
- "47 exclusive territories locked" — shared metric (also used as social proof in Second Chair docs)
- "Zero shared leads" — shared
- "One firm per market" — shared

**Note on metrics:** The 92%, $1,600, and 47 territories metrics originated at Lead Faucet. Second Chair must establish its own independently verified metrics before using any of these in external materials.

## Stat Block

| Stat | Copy |
|------|------|
| 47 | Exclusive markets locked |
| $1,600 | Avg cost per signed case |
| 92% | Qualification acceptance |
| 3 | Practice areas |

🔴 **VERBATIM** — These specific numbers appear in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` as proof points. They are Lead Faucet's metrics. Do not use until Second Chair establishes its own.

---

## Geo-Exclusive Model Section

### H2
> **"One firm per market. No exceptions."**

🔴 **VERBATIM** — Exact phrase appears in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` and `LINKEDIN_COMPANY_PROFILE.md` as a standalone tagline. Must be replaced.

### Body
> "Our proprietary tools — from CaseSnapshot to GetMyVisa — don't just generate leads. They engage your future clients before they ever pick up the phone. And only one firm in each market gets access. No shared systems. No competing for the same click. Your market, your tools, your cases."

🟢 **MONITOR** — The tool-specific language (CaseSnapshot, GetMyVisa) is Lead Faucet's intellectual property. The exclusivity concept ("no competing for the same click") is industry-standard. "Your market, your tools, your cases" is their phrasing — avoid.

### CTA in section
> "See available markets"

🟡 **TONAL** — Scarcity-driven CTA pattern. Second Chair should reconsider the entire "claim your market / see available markets" urgency framing per Davis's strategic direction.

---

## Four-Phase System Section

### H2
> **"Four phases. One system. Predictable cases."**

🟠 **STRUCTURAL** — The four-phase structure itself, and the "predictable cases" outcome language, is directly mirrored in Second Chair's positioning.

### Phase Names and Descriptions

**Phase 01 — Demand Creation**
> "We don't run ads. We occupy attention within your exclusive geography — building brand familiarity and demand saturation through creative systems that earn attention."

🔴 **VERBATIM** — "Demand Creation" as phase name appears identically in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`. The language "we don't run ads" / "earn attention" is also echoed in Second Chair materials.

**Phase 02 — Demand Capture**
> "We shape who raises their hand and how informed they are. Trust before transaction. By the time someone reaches intake, they're calm, qualified, and ready."

🔴 **VERBATIM** — "Demand Capture" as phase name appears identically in Second Chair docs. **"Trust before transaction"** is an exact phrase that appears in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`.

**Phase 03 — Demand Qualification**
> "AI-powered scoring filters every lead against case viability, fraud signals, and eligibility criteria before it reaches your team. We reject aggressively — protecting your margins, your trust, and your long-term economics."

🔴 **VERBATIM** — "Demand Qualification" as phase name appears identically in Second Chair docs. "Protecting your margins" and the rejection-first quality framing are shared.

**Phase 04 — Delivery and Trust**
> "Transparent reporting, consistent communication, and data that beats spin. Bad weeks reported early. No surprises. Operational dependency, not vendor dependency."

🔴 **VERBATIM** — "Delivery and Trust" as phase name appears identically in Second Chair docs. **"Bad weeks reported early. No surprises."** and **"Operational dependency, not vendor dependency"** are exact phrase matches in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`.

---

## "Why Firms Choose Us" Section

### H2
> **"We're not a lead vendor. We're demand infrastructure — built to protect your margins and your reputation."**

🔴 **VERBATIM** — "Demand infrastructure" is a direct positioning phrase used throughout Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`. "We're not a lead vendor" mirrors "We don't just sell leads" framing.

### Three Pillars

**Compliance-first infrastructure**
> "Every lead we deliver comes with a full chain of custody — IP address, timestamp, consent language, and source URL. SB 37, TCPA, 1-to-1 consent. MDL-ready documentation, not just a spreadsheet of names."

🟡 **TONAL** — Compliance framing is industry-standard for legal lead gen. "Chain of custody," "SB 37," "TCPA," "1-to-1 consent" are regulatory terms any player in this space must address. Second Chair can use these but should express them differently.

**AI-powered qualification**
> "We use AI to score leads against case viability criteria before they ever reach your intake team. Fraud detection, exposure verification, and eligibility screening — automated, not manual."

🟡 **TONAL** — AI qualification is a shared category claim. Second Chair's differentiation here is the *creative pre-qualification* angle — the ad itself screens intent before the lead ever enters the funnel. That's a fundamentally different claim.

**Geo-exclusive markets**
> "One firm per geography, per practice area. No shared leads, no competing for the same click. Your market is locked to you — and the tools we build for it are yours alone."

🔴 **VERBATIM** — Language mirrors Second Chair's geo-exclusive positioning throughout `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`. Davis's strategic direction is to move away from geo-exclusivity as a lead selling point.

---

## Partner Intelligence / Reporting Section

### H2
> **"You'll always know exactly what your leads are worth."**

🟡 **TONAL** — Transparent reporting as a differentiator is shared positioning.

### Body
> "Most vendors send you a spreadsheet and call it reporting."

🟠 **STRUCTURAL** — "Vendors who hide behind spreadsheets" is a shared competitive narrative. The specific framing is different but the angle is identical to Second Chair's "Bad weeks reported early / no spin" positioning.

### Four Features
- AI-scored lead quality
- Estimated case value
- Quarterly business reviews
- Growth partnership pricing

🟡 **TONAL** — These are category features. Not verbatim matches in Second Chair docs, but the overall transparent-reporting-as-differentiator framing is shared.

### Dashboard Metrics (shown in UI mockup)
> Leads Delivered: 63 / Signed Cases: 14 / Avg CPSC: $1.1K / ROI: 7,224%

🟢 **MONITOR** — Specific mock data. Not a phrase overlap issue.

---

## Revenue Calculator Section

### H2
> **"Model your firm's economics before we ever talk."**

🟠 **STRUCTURAL** — Calculator as a conversion tool is a Lead Faucet-specific product element. Second Chair has referenced a calculator concept in some documents.

### Calculator Labels
- "The waste you're carrying" / "With Lead Faucet infrastructure"
- "Spent on leads that never sign"

🟡 **TONAL** — The "waste" framing and before/after calculator structure are a shared pattern worth noting.

---

## "Who We Work With" Section

### H2
> **"We don't work with every firm."**

🔴 **VERBATIM** — Exact phrase appears in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` under "Who We Partner With."

### "We partner with firms that" list:
- Already invest in lead generation
- Have intake infrastructure in place
- Want predictability over hype
- Accept geo-exclusivity terms
- Think in terms of cost per signed case, not cost per lead

🔴 **VERBATIM** — This list is reproduced almost word-for-word in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`. The entire structure and most of the individual bullet points are identical.

### "We don't work with" list:
- Price shoppers looking for the cheapest CPL
- Firms without intake discipline
- Anyone who treats leads as a commodity

🔴 **VERBATIM** — This list also appears nearly verbatim in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`.

---

## Scarcity / Closing Section

### H2
> **"Claim your market before someone else does."**

🔴 **VERBATIM** — "Claim your market" language and the scarcity/urgency closing structure appears in Second Chair documents. Davis's stated direction: move away from this type of scarcity-based urgency — it's "salesy" and not appropriate for the high-end attorney audience.

### Body
> "Once a geography is locked to a partner, it stays locked. See if we're a fit."

🔴 **VERBATIM** — "See if we're a fit" appears multiple times. "Once a geography is locked" is the geo-exclusivity urgency play Davis wants to move away from.

### Note at bottom of page
> "Scarcity is strategic. We keep our client roster small so every account gets the infrastructure, attention, and exclusivity it deserves."

🔴 **VERBATIM** — "Scarcity is strategic" appears verbatim in Second Chair's `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` under "Who We Partner With" / proof points section.

---

## Footer Tagline

> "Make a wish" *(appears on multiple pages, tied to faucet visual metaphor)*

🟢 **MONITOR** — Lead Faucet's brand personality element. No overlap with Second Chair.

---

## Summary: Homepage Severity Count

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| 🔴 VERBATIM | 14 |
| 🟠 STRUCTURAL | 3 |
| 🟡 TONAL | 5 |
| 🟢 MONITOR | 2 |

**The homepage is the most critical overlap source.** The Second Chair `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` appears to have been built substantially from this page's language and structure.

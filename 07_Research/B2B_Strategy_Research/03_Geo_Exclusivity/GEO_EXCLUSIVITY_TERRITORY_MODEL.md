# Geo-Exclusivity Territory Model: Per-State vs. Per-DMA vs. Per-Metro

> **For:** Danny  
> **From:** Davis  
> **Purpose:** Clarify how geo-exclusivity should be defined and priced for multi-location law firms — and align on the right commercial model before we scale outreach

## The Problem We Need to Solve

Right now, geo-exclusivity isn't clearly defined for multi-location firms. Jacoby & Meyers gets whole-state exclusivity (CA, CO, NV, WA) — one contract, one firm, entire state locked. That model made sense to close a large anchor client, but we're now reaching out to firms that span multiple cities and multiple states, and the question isn't answered:

**If a law firm has offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego — do they get all of California? Just those three metros? Something else? And what do we charge?**

This needs to be settled before we scale outreach, because we're going to get this question constantly from larger prospects, and our answer determines both our revenue ceiling and our competitive positioning.

## Critical Distinction: "Exclusive Leads" vs. "Exclusive Territory"

Before getting into the per-state vs. per-metro debate, it's important to name the distinction that separates Second Chair from almost every competitor in the space.

**Exclusive lead** — The same individual lead record isn't sold to two buyers. A firm gets the contact info, no one else gets that same contact info. This is what Legal Brand Marketing, Ngage, and most "exclusive" lead vendors actually sell.

**Exclusive territory** — No competing firm in your market can buy from this vendor at all. If you're the exclusive client for Los Angeles, your competitor cannot become a client in Los Angeles. Ever.

These sound similar. They are not.

Legal Brand Marketing's own Terms of Service (updated January 2026) makes this explicit:

> *"Contacts in Kentucky will be delivered to the Participant on an exclusive basis, however, the Participant does not have exclusive territorial rights."*

That means two competing PI firms in Louisville can both be buying "exclusive" leads from LBM simultaneously. They never get the same lead record — but they are both buying from the same inventory, through the same funnel, targeting the same pool of injured consumers. They are functionally competing through the same vendor.

**Second Chair offers exclusive territory. Almost no one else does.** The only direct competitor with a comparable model is Taqtics — and they're CTV-focused (brand awareness), not bottom-of-funnel lead gen.

This distinction is a sales argument, not just a positioning statement. When a prospect says "Legal Brand Marketing sells exclusive leads," the correct response is: "They sell exclusive lead records. We sell an exclusive market. Two firms in Los Angeles can both be LBM clients. Only one firm in Los Angeles can be a Second Chair client."

## The Core Question

> **How do we define geo-exclusivity for multi-location firms — and what should our standard territory unit be?**

Specifically:

1. **What is the unit of exclusivity going forward?** State? DMA? MSA? Something else?

2. **For multi-location firms:** If a firm has offices in 3 cities in the same state, do they get the entire state? Just the markets where they have offices? A bundle?

3. **For multi-state firms:** If a firm operates in 5 states, are they buying 5 market exclusivities? A custom multi-state package? Something else entirely?

4. **Is the Jacoby model (whole-state) the standard, or was that a one-off deal for a large anchor client?** If it's the standard, we need to understand what that does to our ability to sell other firms in the same state.

5. **What should the pricing structure look like?** Per DMA? Per MSA? Bundled? Tiered by market size?

## What's at Stake: Revenue Ceiling by Territory Model

This is not just a pricing question — the choice of territory unit directly determines the maximum number of clients we can ever have nationally, which determines our revenue ceiling.

**The three models and their ceilings:**

| Territory Unit | Max Clients (Full US) | Avg ARR per Client | Maximum ARR Ceiling |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Per State** (current Jacoby) | 50 | $800K–$1.2M | $40M–$60M |
| **Per DMA** (what Taqtics uses) | 210 | $400K–$800K | $84M–$168M |
| **Per MSA** (Census metro areas) | 382 | $300K–$650K | $115M–$248M |

**The California illustration:**  
California has 25 MSAs and roughly 7 major DMAs (LA, SF, Sacramento, San Diego, Fresno, Bakersfield, and others).

- **Per-state:** 1 California client. $800K–$1.2M ARR. Everything else locked.
- **Per-DMA:** Up to 7 California clients. $400K–$800K each. $2.8M–$5.6M ARR from California alone.
- **Per-MSA:** Up to 25 California clients. $300K–$650K each. $7.5M–$16.3M ARR from California alone.

The per-state model caps California at ~$1M ARR. The per-DMA model opens it to $5.6M. The per-MSA model opens it to $16M+. That delta compounds across every state.

## The Three Territory Unit Options

### Option 1: Per-State (Current Jacoby Model)

**Pros:**
- Simple to pitch and explain — law firms understand state-level licensing and advertising
- Appeals to large regional firms who operate statewide
- One contract, one relationship, easier to manage
- State lines are legally unambiguous

**Cons:**
- **Revenue ceiling of $40–60M nationally** — far below the real opportunity
- Massive opportunity cost: a state-wide lock blocks all other firms in that state, even in markets the client never serves
- No relationship to actual service area — a firm with offices in LA and SF doesn't serve Fresno
- Creates a precedent that every large prospect will expect to replicate
- **Caps us at 50 clients nationally**

---

### Option 2: Per-DMA (Recommended Standard — What Taqtics Uses)

**What is a DMA?** Designated Market Area — Nielsen's 210 geographic markets that define local media regions. DMAs are the standard unit for TV, radio, CTV, and streaming advertising. PI law firms already understand and budget by DMA because it's how they buy television.

**Pros:**
- **Revenue ceiling of $84M–$168M nationally** — 2–3x the per-state model
- PI firms already understand DMA — it's how they think about media markets and advertising territories
- Boundaries are published and unambiguous (Nielsen DMA map — no arguments about what's included)
- Taqtics' use validates it as a credible industry standard for territory exclusivity
- Fewer units than MSA (210 vs. 382) means easier inventory management while still dramatically expanding capacity
- When a prospect asks "what's my territory," you point to the DMA map — clean, visual, understood

**Cons:**
- Larger territories than MSA — some DMAs are very large (LA DMA includes the Inland Empire, much of SoCal)
- 210 slots vs. 382 means less granularity; some markets that are functionally separate (e.g., SF and San Jose) may be in the same DMA
- Slightly less revenue upside than the MSA model

---

### Option 3: Per-MSA (Maximum Granularity)

**What is an MSA?** Metropolitan Statistical Area — 382 Census Bureau-defined metro economies. More granular than DMA, based on population/economic data rather than media markets.

**Pros:**
- **Revenue ceiling of $115M–$248M nationally** — the highest possible ceiling
- More markets = more clients = more revenue
- Captures distinct local economies (SF and San Jose are separate MSAs; they're in the same DMA)

**Cons:**
- Less intuitive to PI attorneys — MSA is a Census term, not an advertising term
- Boundary disputes are more likely — MSA definitions are more complex and less visually obvious than DMA maps
- Harder to enforce in contracts — "what exactly is the Riverside-San Bernardino MSA?" requires more explanation than "what's the LA DMA?"

## The Multi-Location Firm Scenarios

### Scenario A: Multi-City, Same State
*Example: Firm with offices in LA, San Francisco, and San Diego*

Options:
1. **Sell them 3 DMAs.** They get the LA DMA + SF DMA + San Diego DMA, charged per DMA. Fresno DMA, Sacramento DMA, etc. remain open.
2. **Sell them the whole state.** They get California. Block all 7 DMAs.
3. **Sell them a regional bundle.** "SoCal" (LA + San Diego DMAs) + "NorCal" (SF DMA) as a bundle with a modest discount.

**Recommended:** Option 1 or 3. They pay for what they actually use; we protect the rest of the state.

---

### Scenario B: Multi-State Firm
*Example: Firm with offices in CA, TX, FL, NY, and IL*

Options:
1. **Per DMA in each state.** They buy their specific DMAs — LA, Dallas, Miami, NYC, Chicago. Everything else stays open.
2. **Per state, 5 states.** They get all 5 states locked. Gives away $84M+ in potential revenue to one firm.
3. **Custom multi-state enterprise package.** Bundle their primary DMAs across states with a volume discount. Each DMA is named and locked.

**Recommended:** Option 1 with Option 3 framing. Sell them their markets, name every DMA explicitly in the contract, and offer a bundle discount for volume. Keep everything else open.

**This is where we need Danny's direction.** A firm like Morgan & Morgan will push for broad national exclusivity. Our answer needs to be ready.

---

### Scenario C: Large Statewide Advertiser (The Jacoby Model)
*Example: A firm that genuinely runs statewide TV/radio campaigns and wants every lead in the state*

For firms that actually operate statewide, a state-wide package can still exist — but it must be **priced as the sum of the individual DMAs it contains**, not as a flat state fee.

- California state-wide = all 7 CA DMAs bundled → priced at aggregate DMA value with modest bundle discount
- Colorado state-wide = 3 CO DMAs → priced accordingly (much cheaper than California)
- This prevents the trap of pricing CA and CO the same just because both are "one state"

**Recommended pricing logic:** State-wide = named DMA bundle with 10–15% discount vs. buying each DMA individually.

---

## Pros & Cons: The Full Picture

### Per-State Model

**Pros:**
- Simplest to sell and explain
- Appeals to large regional firms
- Legally unambiguous
- One relationship per state

**Cons:**
- Caps revenue at $40–60M nationally (50 clients max)
- Blocks markets the client never serves
- No pricing logic for state size variation (CA vs. CO treated identically)
- Sets a precedent that every large prospect expects to replicate

---

### Per-DMA Model (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- 210 US markets vs. 50 states — revenue ceiling 2–3x higher ($84M–$168M)
- Clients already understand DMA — it's how they buy TV and streaming media
- Taqtics validates it as the industry standard for territory exclusivity
- Nielsen publishes DMA maps — unambiguous boundaries, no disputes
- Bundle pricing is intuitive (SoCal = 2 DMAs, NorCal = 1 DMA)

**Cons:**
- Some DMAs are large — a firm might want only part of the LA DMA
- 210 slots vs. 382 MSAs leaves some revenue upside on the table
- Requires learning a new vocabulary if team is currently using MSA/metro language

---

### Per-MSA Model

**Pros:**
- 382 markets — highest possible revenue ceiling ($115M–$248M)
- Most granular alignment with actual metro populations
- Allows selling SF and San Jose as separate territories (they're in the same DMA)

**Cons:**
- MSA is not advertising language — PI firms won't immediately understand it
- More complex boundaries = more contract disputes
- Harder to explain to prospects than DMA or state

---

## Suggested Framework

**The Standard Product: Per-DMA Exclusivity**

One firm per DMA. Pricing tiers by DMA market size:
- Tier 1 (Mega — LA, NYC, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami): $400–$500/lead
- Tier 2 (Large — SF, San Diego, Tampa, Denver, Phoenix, Seattle): $350–$450/lead
- Tier 3–5 (Mid/Small/Micro — Fresno, Bakersfield, Corpus Christi, etc.): $200–$350/lead

**The Bundle Product: Multi-DMA or State Packages**

For firms that want multiple markets:
- "SoCal Bundle" (LA DMA + San Diego DMA): 10% discount vs. individual pricing
- "California Bundle" (all CA DMAs): 15% discount vs. individual DMA pricing
- "Multi-State Enterprise" (national firms): Custom pricing — each DMA named, bundled at volume discount

**The Enterprise Exception: State or Multi-State Packages**

For firms like Jacoby who want statewide coverage:
- Price as the sum of all named DMAs in that state, minus a 10–15% bundle discount
- Each DMA must be explicitly listed in the contract (protects us from implied coverage of DMAs not served)
- Minimum 12-month contract; annual review of volume delivery by DMA

---

## What We Need to Align On

1. **Do we adopt DMA as our standard territory unit?** This is the core decision. DMA aligns with how clients think about media markets, is validated by Taqtics, and is unambiguous.

2. **What does Jacoby's contract actually say?** Are they paying for "California" as a state, or for specific markets? This matters for whether other California DMAs are available to sell.

3. **For multi-location firms wanting multiple DMAs — do we offer bundle pricing, or sell each DMA individually?**

4. **Do we grandfather Jacoby's model or migrate them to DMA-based pricing?**

5. **What's the answer when a prospect says "I want the whole state"?** It exists as a bundle product — but priced as the sum of the DMAs, not a flat state fee.

---

## Who Should Be in This Conversation

**Danny** — Set the Jacoby precedent, closest to how deals have been structured. His view on commercial intent is what matters most.

**Sasha** — On the frontlines of outreach and will face this question on every discovery call. Needs a crisp, one-sentence answer for what geo-exclusivity means.

**Contracts** — Before finalizing DMA territory definitions, the DMA boundaries need to be written into contracts. A reference to the Nielsen DMA map by name and year is the cleanest approach — avoids any boundary dispute.

**Competitive prep** — The sales distinction between "exclusive leads" (LBM/Ngage) and "exclusive territory" (Second Chair/Taqtics) should be part of every discovery and sales deck. Prospects often don't know this distinction exists.

---

## The Recommended Position

**Adopt DMA as the standard territory unit. Move to per-DMA exclusivity as the default product.**

The per-state model served its purpose to land Jacoby fast. It is not the scalable model. It caps the revenue ceiling at $40–60M when the DMA model opens it to $84–168M, and the MSA model opens it further.

The DMA model is the right standard because:
1. It's how PI firms already think about their markets
2. Taqtics validates it as the industry standard for territory exclusivity
3. Nielsen's published DMA map makes boundaries unambiguous and legally defensible
4. 210 slots vs. 50 states means we can grow 4x more clients

For multi-location firms: sell them their specific DMAs, named explicitly, with bundle pricing for volume. For firms that want statewide coverage: sell it as a DMA bundle at aggregate DMA pricing with a discount — never a flat state fee.

The goal: when a large firm says "I want all of California," the answer is "Great — California has 7 DMAs. Here's what each costs, here's the bundle price, and here's what stays open when we lock your territory."

**The sales argument that arms the team:**  
"Legal Brand Marketing sells exclusive leads. We sell an exclusive market. Two firms in Los Angeles can both be LBM clients at the same time, buying from the same inventory, competing for the same injured consumers. Only one firm in the Los Angeles DMA can ever be a Second Chair client."

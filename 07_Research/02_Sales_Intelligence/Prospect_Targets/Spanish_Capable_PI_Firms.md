# Spanish-Capable PI Firms — B2B Target Profile
## PI Law Firms With Spanish Intake Capacity: Second Chair's Highest-Value Hispanic Market Partners

**Research Date:** February 28, 2026
**Assembled by:** Strategic Research Team
**Purpose:** Identify PI law firms that have already invested in Spanish-speaking intake infrastructure and therefore represent the highest-priority B2B targets for Second Chair's Spanish-language lead generation product

---

## Why This List Exists

Second Chair's Spanish-language B2C advertising generates leads that require a different attorney partner than standard English-market leads. A Spanish-speaking accident victim who was reached by authentic Spanish advertising, who filled out a Spanish-language form, and who expects a Spanish-speaking intake call — cannot be routed to a firm with no Spanish staff.

The firms on this list have already made the investment in Spanish-speaking intake capacity. This means:

1. **Second Chair's Spanish leads convert better for them** — no intake language barrier, no lost contacts because the client couldn't communicate
2. **They are already spending to acquire this audience** — they understand its value and have committed resources to serve it
3. **Second Chair's pitch lands differently** — it is not "here are leads, try them." It is "we generate leads from the community you've already built your intake team to serve, in the language your staff speaks, and we route them exclusively to firms like yours."

These are not generic lead gen prospects. They are partners for a specific product that does not exist elsewhere in the market.

## The B2B Pitch for Spanish-Capable Firms

Before the firm profiles: the pitch is structurally different from the standard Second Chair B2B pitch.

**Standard pitch:** "We run honest consumer advertising and measure cost-per-signed-case. Try us alongside your current vendors with 100 leads."

**Spanish-market pitch:**
> "You've already built the intake infrastructure to serve Spanish-speaking accident victims. Most of your competitors haven't. The problem is that the leads reaching you are generated by English-language advertising that reaches the Spanish-speaking community incidentally — which means the claimant wasn't expecting a Spanish-speaking firm, didn't understand what they were signing up for, and converts at lower rates.
>
> We run Spanish-language consumer advertising specifically designed for this community — reviewed by native speakers, not translated from English. Every lead we generate from this campaign comes from someone who saw an ad in Spanish, filled out a form in Spanish, and is expecting a Spanish-speaking intake call. We route these leads exclusively to firms with Spanish intake capacity. In this market, that's a short list. You're on it.
>
> We're not asking you to switch anything you're currently running. We're asking you to allocate a test budget to a lead source that was built specifically for the clients you already know how to serve."

This pitch has three advantages over the standard version: (1) it is specific to their existing investment, (2) it explains why their current Spanish-lead conversion rate is probably lower than it should be, and (3) it positions exclusivity — you are on a short list — without false scarcity.

## Firm Profiles

---

### 1. Jacoby & Meyers

**Profile type:** National mega-firm with deep Hispanic infrastructure
**Founded:** 1972
**Geographic footprint:** National — California, New York, Florida, and additional states
**Revenue estimate:** $100M+ (est.; not publicly disclosed)
**Employees:** ~113 (LinkedIn)

**Spanish intake capacity:**
- Dedicated Spanish phone lines: 1-866-404-1422 and 1-877-492-1555 (confirmed active)
- Dedicated Spanish-language website: ganatucaso.com ("Win Your Case" in Spanish)
- Explicit "Clientes Hispanohablantes" section on main site
- "Se Habla Español" featured across all marketing
- Bilingual attorneys in California, New York, and Florida offices

**Practice focus:** MVA, truck accidents, motorcycle accidents, dangerous drugs, defective products, wrongful death, medical malpractice — full PI scope

**Why they're a high-priority target:**
- They have already built the most visible Spanish-language legal brand infrastructure of any major PI firm nationally
- ganatucaso.com is a standalone Spanish consumer brand — which means they understand the separate-brand strategy Second Chair is implementing and will immediately understand the value of Spanish-language lead gen that matches it
- Their intake team is designed for Spanish-speaking clients
- Scale: they can absorb high lead volume, which means Second Chair can grow the relationship without hitting a capacity ceiling

**Second Chair's angle for this pitch:**
Jacoby & Meyers built ganatucaso.com because they know this audience is underserved. But they are running their own consumer marketing through a law firm brand — which has compliance constraints, creative limitations, and brand attribution requirements. Second Chair operates as a third-party brand: no attorney name in the ad creative, attorney name only in the consent form at conversion. This means Second Chair can run consumer advertising that Jacoby & Meyers legally and ethically cannot — specifically, advertising that does not carry an attorney's name but reaches the same audience.

**Decision-maker type:** Chief Marketing Officer or VP of Marketing at a firm this size; possibly practice group head for PI/MVA specifically. Not the founding partners.

### 2. Morgan & Morgan

**Profile type:** Largest PI firm in the U.S. by revenue and case volume
**Founded:** 1988
**Geographic footprint:** National — 50 states, 900+ attorneys
**Revenue estimate:** $3B+ (est.)
**Case history:** $30B+ recovered, 700,000+ clients

**Spanish intake capacity:**
- Spanish-speaking attorneys and intake staff confirmed in Florida, Texas, California, and New York offices
- Spanish-language marketing in Florida and Texas markets
- "Se Habla Español" service across primary markets
- Scale of intake infrastructure means Spanish-speaking staff at every major market office

**Practice focus:** MVA, slip/fall, medical malpractice, workplace injury — all PI practice areas; enormous intake operation handles all lead types

**Why they're a high-priority target:**
- Morgan & Morgan's model is built on volume — they will try any semi-legitimate lead source (the Jacoby & Meyers "50 leads to start" behavior applies here equally or more)
- Their intake infrastructure is large enough to absorb 100+ Spanish leads per month without operational friction
- The firm's nationwide presence means Second Chair can pitch to Morgan & Morgan for multiple markets simultaneously

**Second Chair's angle for this pitch:**
Morgan & Morgan's scale is an advantage and a risk. They work with many lead vendors and measure everything by CPL and CPSC at scale. The Spanish-language pitch must be quantitative: "Here is the expected CPSC differential between English-market leads and language-matched Spanish-market leads, and here is why language matching produces a better conversion rate at intake." If Second Chair can show data from early Hispanic-market campaigns — even 50 leads — that validates a higher sign rate, Morgan & Morgan will scale the relationship fast.

**Decision-maker type:** At this scale, there is a dedicated lead gen procurement team. The pitch needs to go through their marketing/business development function, not a founding partner.

### 3. The Dominguez Firm

**Profile type:** Large Hispanic-owned PI firm; dominant in LA Mexican/Central American community
**Founded:** 1984
**Geographic footprint:** Los Angeles, CA (primary); California-wide
**Revenue estimate:** $50M–$100M (est.)
**Case history:** Over $1 billion recovered, 96% success rate claimed

**Spanish intake capacity:**
- Hispanic-founded and Hispanic-led — the firm's identity is built around the community
- All staff bilingual in Spanish and English
- Spanish-language advertising and community presence as a primary strategy, not an add-on
- Deep roots in LA Mexican and Central American communities

**Practice focus:** MVA, serious personal injury, wrongful death, elder abuse — significant MVA volume in LA market

**Why they're a high-priority target:**
- The Dominguez Firm is the natural B2B partner for Second Chair's LA Spanish-market campaign because they are already the dominant Hispanic PI brand in that market
- They have existing relationships and trust with the same community Second Chair will be reaching through advertising
- Spanish leads delivered to The Dominguez Firm arrive in an intake system that is 100% designed for them — highest possible conversion rate

**Second Chair's angle for this pitch:**
The Dominguez Firm runs its own consumer advertising. Second Chair is not competing with their advertising — Second Chair is running third-party advertising that reaches accident victims before they've made a firm decision, and routing those who are looking for representation to The Dominguez Firm. The pitch is a lead augmentation play, not a replacement for their existing marketing.

**Important note:** The Dominguez Firm's brand is built on being the Hispanic firm. Second Chair's Spanish-language page (¿Tuviste un Accidente?) does not carry The Dominguez Firm's name in the ad creative — only in the consent form. This preserves the firm's brand integrity while extending their reach through Second Chair's consumer advertising.

**Decision-maker type:** Likely direct access to founding principal or a senior marketing director. Smaller firm structure means decisions are made closer to the top.

### 4. Arcia & Associates

**Profile type:** Largest minority-owned PI firm in New York; construction accident specialty
**Founded:** N/A (established; exact founding not confirmed)
**Geographic footprint:** New York City (primary); New York state
**Revenue estimate:** $10M–$30M (est.)

**Spanish intake capacity:**
- Bilingual Spanish/English — firm identity is built on serving minority communities including Hispanic construction workers
- Construction accident specialty is significant: Hispanic workers are disproportionately represented in construction accident fatalities and injuries — the firm's client base is heavily Spanish-speaking
- "The largest minority-owned firm in New York" is their stated identity

**Practice focus:** Construction accidents (highest value cases), personal injury, civil rights, general PI — significant focus on workplace injury which overlaps with Hispanic worker demographics

**Why they're a high-priority target:**
- New York has the largest concentration of Puerto Rican and Dominican Hispanic population outside of those islands
- Arcia's construction accident specialty means their existing client base is already heavily Spanish-speaking
- Second Chair's Spanish PI campaign will generate MVA leads — but construction accidents are also within scope of PI, and the audience overlap (Spanish-speaking workers, working-class, underinsured) is significant
- The firm already understands the intake requirements for Spanish-speaking clients

**Second Chair's angle for this pitch:**
Arcia is already serving this community in construction — Second Chair can extend that relationship into MVA, where Arcia may not have a dominant lead generation source. The pitch: "You already know how to serve Spanish-speaking New Yorkers. We generate MVA leads from that community. Let us feed your intake team a lead type that matches the clients you're best positioned to serve."

**Decision-maker type:** Small firm structure; likely direct access to founding principals or senior partner.

### 5. Torres Law Group

**Profile type:** Bilingual PI firm; Bay Area with multi-million dollar recoveries
**Founded:** 2004 by Roseann Torres
**Geographic footprint:** San Francisco Bay Area
**Revenue estimate:** $5M–$15M (est.)

**Spanish intake capacity:**
- Founded by a Latina attorney; bilingual firm by identity
- Bay Area Mexican and Central American community focus
- Spanish-language intake and attorney consultation available

**Practice focus:** Serious personal injury, wrongful death, catastrophic injury — high-value case focus

**Why they're a high-priority target:**
- Bay Area is an underserved Spanish-language PI market despite significant Hispanic population in Oakland, San Jose, and specific SF neighborhoods
- Torres Law Group's founding story (Latina attorney building a firm specifically to serve her community) creates genuine mission alignment with Second Chair's justice-oriented brand values
- Second Chair's authentic Spanish advertising is a more natural fit here than with large corporate firms

**Second Chair's angle for this pitch:**
Values-forward. Torres Law Group was built to serve a community that large firms ignored. Second Chair is building a lead generation product around the same insight. The pitch emphasizes mission alignment alongside the business case.

**Decision-maker type:** Likely directly with Roseann Torres or a senior partner. Small firm — decisions are made at the top.

### 6. VAMOS Law Group

**Profile type:** Bilingual PI and immigration firm; Rio Grande Valley Texas
**Founded:** N/A
**Geographic footprint:** McAllen / Rio Grande Valley TX — one of the most heavily Hispanic metros in the U.S.
**Revenue estimate:** $3M–$10M (est.)

**Spanish intake capacity:**
- Explicitly bilingual practice; name "VAMOS" signals Spanish-first identity
- Rio Grande Valley is 92% Hispanic — the firm's market is nearly entirely Spanish-speaking
- Personal injury alongside immigration and criminal defense

**Practice focus:** MVA personal injury + immigration + criminal defense; multi-practice bilingual firm

**Why they're a high-priority target:**
- The Rio Grande Valley is the single most underserved PI market for lead generation relative to population density
- VAMOS is positioned in a market where virtually every accident victim is a potential Spanish-speaking lead
- The firm's multi-practice structure means they see accident victims across multiple entry points (immigration clients who have accidents, criminal defense clients who need PI referrals)

**Second Chair's angle for this pitch:**
The Rio Grande Valley is not a priority market for most large lead gen companies — it is geographically specific and requires Spanish-only execution. Second Chair's Spanish campaign can enter this market with minimal competition. VAMOS is the natural partner. The pitch: "We can generate Spanish PI leads in a market that no major lead gen company is actively working. Your intake team is built for it. This is a market with zero competition for what we'd be doing together."

**Decision-maker type:** Direct to founding principals. Small firm.

## B2B Outreach Sequence for Spanish-Capable Firms

The outreach to these firms is different from standard Second Chair cold outreach. The sequence:

**1. Pre-call homework:** Confirm Spanish intake capacity is active (call their Spanish phone line or visit their Spanish website). Know which markets they serve.

**2. Opening hook:** Reference their Spanish infrastructure specifically. "I called your Spanish line to verify it was active before reaching out. It is." This signals Second Chair is not a generic lead vendor and has done due diligence.

**3. The specific problem statement:** "You've built the intake for this community. The problem is the leads reaching you weren't generated from advertising that spoke to this community in their language. They came from broad English targeting that incidentally reached Spanish speakers — which is why the conversion rate from Spanish-speaking leads is lower than it should be."

**4. The product statement:** "We run Spanish-language consumer advertising — reviewed by native speakers, not translated from English — that reaches accident victims before the insurance adjuster has set the frame. Every lead from this campaign is Spanish-speaking, expects a Spanish-speaking intake call, and was reached by advertising that set honest expectations. We route these exclusively to firms with Spanish intake. You qualify."

**5. The test:** "Start with 50 leads alongside what you're already running. Measure the sign rate against your English-market leads. We believe you'll see a measurable difference."

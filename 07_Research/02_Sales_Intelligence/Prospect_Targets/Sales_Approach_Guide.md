## Roma's Strategic Decision: Who to Contact at Whale Firms

**The Golden Rule:** Always contact the person who can say 'yes' without asking permission.

### The Contact Strategy Decision Tree

| Firm Size | Structure | PRIMARY CONTACT | Why | Sales Cycle | Close Rate |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----|-------------|------------|
| **10-50 attorneys** | No Marketing Director | → **Managing Partner** | They ARE the decision-maker | 2-4 weeks | 30% |
| **50+ attorneys** | No Marketing Director | → **Senior/Founding Partner** | No gatekeeper = direct access | 1-3 weeks | 40% |
| **50+ attorneys** | Has Marketing Director/CMO | → **Marketing Director FIRST** | They control vendor relationships | 4-8 weeks | 20% |

### The Critical Exception: When to Contact Marketing Director First

**ONLY contact Marketing Director first if:**
1. Firm has 50+ attorneys AND
2. They have a **real CMO/Marketing Director** (not just "marketing coordinator") AND
3. That person has clear authority over vendor relationships

**From our whale lists, this applies to ONE firm:**
- ✅ **Rubenstein Law** (Manish Mehta, CMO) - 400+ employees, sophisticated marketing infrastructure

**For ALL other whales → Go directly to Managing Partner**

### Why Skip Marketing Coordinators?

Most 10-50 attorney firms have a "marketing coordinator" who:
- Manages social media posts
- Coordinates with outside agencies
- Handles administrative marketing tasks
- **But does NOT make vendor purchasing decisions**

The managing partner still makes the call. Going to the coordinator first just adds a layer and slows you down.

## The Whale Buyer Personas

Whales (8+ attorney firms) typically fall into **three buyer personas**, not four. The "Hungry Solo" doesn't exist at whale scale. Your whale prospects are:

### Persona 1: Jennifer Walsh — The Established Builder (10-50 attorneys)

**Profile:**
- Managing partner or founding partner
- Mid-size firm (10-50 attorneys)
- Growth mode, scaling operations
- Sophisticated about marketing ROI
- Has marketing team or coordinator (but partner still makes final call)

**What They Care About:**
- Scalability and predictable case flow
- Competitive positioning against Morgan & Morgan-type mega firms
- Data and reporting (but partner-level, not CMO-level)
- Strategic partnership, not vendor relationship

**Sales Approach:**
- **Position as infrastructure, not leads:** "We're not selling leads—we're selling geo-exclusive demand infrastructure"
- **Emphasize competitive advantage:** "Morgan & Morgan spends $350M on advertising. You don't need that budget—you need exclusive territory."
- **Show scalability:** "We can start with 20 leads/month and scale to 50+ as your intake capacity grows"
- **Build partnership narrative:** "One firm per market—you're not buying leads, you're becoming our NYC partner"

**Discovery Questions (Voss + NEPQ):**
- "How are you currently differentiating from Morgan & Morgan in your market?" (Voss: calibrated question)
- "What's your growth target for case volume this year?" (NEPQ: future pacing)
- "On a scale of 1-10, how important is predictable monthly case flow to your growth plans?" (NEPQ: scale question)
- "If you could own exclusive territory in NYC, what would that be worth to your competitive position?" (NEPQ: future pacing + value anchoring)

---

### Persona 2: The Tired King — Pre-Retirement Partner (50+ attorneys or 55+ years old)

**Profile:**
- Founding or senior partner, 55-65 years old
- Built successful practice over decades
- Tired of chasing leads, wants stability
- Looking for "one more big run" before retirement or selling firm

**What They Care About:**
- Stability and predictability (NOT growth for growth's sake)
- Not having to manage vendors
- Simple, turnkey solution
- Protecting margins before exit

**Sales Approach:**
- **Lead with stability:** "Turnkey demand infrastructure. You don't manage vendors—we just deliver qualified cases every month."
- **Position as exit strategy enabler:** "Predictable case flow increases practice value when you're ready to sell or transition"
- **Emphasize low-maintenance:** "Set it and forget it. We handle everything—you just work the cases."
- **Show how exclusivity protects market position:** "Lock in your territory now, before a competitor does"

**Discovery Questions (Voss + NEPQ):**
- "How much longer do you plan to practice actively?" (NEPQ: commitment question)
- "Are you considering selling or transitioning the practice?" (Direct, but with empathy)
- "What would it mean to you to have predictable case flow without the daily vendor management grind?" (Voss: label the pain)
- "If you could lock in your territory now and not worry about lead gen for the next 5 years, what would that be worth to you?" (NEPQ: future pacing + value anchoring)

---

### Persona 3: Marcus Chen — The Marketing Director (50+ attorneys)

**Profile:**
- Marketing Director (NOT attorney—professional marketer)
- Reports to partners/management committee
- Data-driven, sophisticated buyer
- Longer sales cycle (4-8 weeks, requires partner approval)

**What They Care About:**
- **Data and metrics** (dashboards, reporting, cost-per-signed-case tracking)
- Vendor reliability (they manage multiple vendors, need accountability)
- Proving ROI to partners (their job depends on marketing performance)
- Strategic positioning (they think in terms of competitive advantage, not just leads)

**Sales Approach:**
- **Lead with data:** "92% acceptance rate, $1,600 average cost per signed case, exclusive territory"
- **Emphasize transparent reporting:** "Real-time dashboard, full lead attribution, integration with your CRM"
- **Position as strategic partner:** "We're not a vendor you manage—we're a channel you optimize"
- **Consultative, longer process:** Expect 4-8 weeks, multiple stakeholders, partner approval required

**Discovery Questions (Voss + NEPQ):**
- "What metrics do the partners care most about when evaluating lead gen?" (Understand their internal sales challenge)
- "How do you currently report on lead gen ROI to the partners?" (Understand their process)
- "On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with your current lead sources?" (NEPQ: scale question—creates dissatisfaction)
- "Who else would need to be involved in this decision?" (Voss: uncover hidden decision-makers)

## The Whale Sales Cycle

| Firm Size | Buyer Persona | Sales Cycle | Close Rate | Key Factor |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **10-50 attorneys** | Jennifer Walsh (Builder) | 2-4 weeks | 30% | Small committee, partner-driven decision |
| **50+ attorneys** | Tired King (Retiring) | 1-3 weeks | 40% | Fast decision if they're ready to simplify |
| **50+ attorneys** | Marcus Chen (Marketing Dir) | 4-8 weeks | 20% | Large committee, procurement, partner approval |

**Whale Sweet Spot:** Jennifer Walsh firms (10-50 attorneys) = strong close rate + reasonable cycle time

---

## The Whale Outreach Process

### Stage 1: LinkedIn Research & Connection (Days 1-3)

**Before you reach out, research:**
1. **LinkedIn profile:** Title, tenure, background
2. **Firm LinkedIn page:** Recent posts, announcements, hires
3. **News/PR:** Recent verdicts, settlements, awards
4. **Website:** About page, attorney bios, case results

**LinkedIn Connection Request Template:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I came across [Firm Name] while researching top PI firms in [City]. 
Impressive work on [recent verdict/case/award].

I work with large PI firms on geo-exclusive lead infrastructure—wondering 
if it makes sense to connect?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:** You're demonstrating you did research (specific case/award), you're positioning yourself as peer (not vendor), and you're asking permission.

---

### Stage 2: Cold Email Sequence (Days 1-14)

**Email 1: Problem + Exclusivity (Day 0)**

```
Subject: Exclusive: [City] PI lead generation

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Are you open to a conversation about exclusive PI lead 
generation for [City metro]?

We work with one firm per market—[City] is still available, but we have 
other firms interested.

We've helped firms like yours generate qualified PI cases at $1,600 per 
signed case with 92% acceptance rates.

15 minutes to discuss before we commit your market to another firm?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Phone]
```

**Email 2: Value-Add (Day 3)**

```
Subject: Re: Exclusive: [City] PI lead generation

Hi [First Name],

Following up—wanted to share a quick case study:

[Firm in similar market] was spending $45K/month on Google Ads with 
$8,000+ cost per signed case. They switched to our exclusive territory 
model and now get $1,600 cost per signed case with predictable monthly 
case flow.

The difference? Geo-exclusivity. No bidding wars. No shared leads. 
One firm per market.

[City] is still available. Worth a conversation?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 3: Breakup Email (Day 7)**

```
Subject: Should I take you off my list?

Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming exclusive PI lead generation for 
[City] isn't a priority right now.

Should I take you off my list and move forward with one of the other 
firms interested in your market?

Just let me know either way.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why breakup emails work:** They create urgency through scarcity. Many prospects respond to breakup emails who ignored the first two.

---

### Stage 3: Phone Call (Week 1-2)

**When they respond, schedule a 15-20 minute discovery call.**

**Opening (Chris Voss Tactical Empathy):**

"Thanks for taking the time. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. 

Before I tell you about what we do, I'm curious—what's your current situation with lead generation? Are you happy with your lead sources, or is there room for improvement?"

**Why this works:** You're asking, not telling. You're giving them permission to complain. You're using Voss's "calibrated questions" to uncover pain.

**Discovery Questions (Voss + NEPQ Framework):**

1. **Current State:** "How are you currently generating new PI cases?" (Voss: open-ended)
2. **Pain Discovery:** "What's your biggest frustration with your current lead sources?" (Voss: label the pain)
3. **Financial Impact:** "What's your cost per signed case from Google Ads / current sources?" (Get them calculating)
4. **Emotional Commitment:** "On a scale of 1-10, how important is predictable monthly case flow to your growth plans?" (NEPQ: scale question—anything less than 10, ask "What would it take to make it a 10?")
5. **Future Pacing:** "If you could lock down exclusive territory in [City], what would that mean for your competitive position?" (NEPQ: get them visualizing the future state)
6. **Hidden Objections:** "What concerns do you have about working with a lead generation company?" (Voss: accusation audit—surface objections early)

**Presenting the Offer (Challenger Sale):**

Don't just pitch features. **Teach them something they don't know:**

"Here's something most PI firms don't realize: the cost-per-lead doesn't matter. What matters is cost-per-signed-case.

Most firms anchor on 'This lead costs $400, that's expensive.' But if that $400 lead converts at 20% and delivers a $1,600 cost per signed case, it's actually cheaper than a $50 shared lead that converts at 2% and delivers $2,500 cost per signed case.

The reason our clients get lower cost-per-signed-case is exclusivity. No race to the phone. No bidding wars. One firm per market.

Does that make sense?"

**Why this works:** You're reframing their thinking (Challenger Sale), educating them (builds trust), and anchoring them to cost-per-signed-case instead of cost-per-lead.

---

### Stage 4: Objection Handling (Throughout Process)

Whales have sophisticated objections. Here's how to handle the most common:

#### Objection 1: "We've been burned by lead gen companies before."

**Voss Response (Tactical Empathy + Label):**

"It sounds like you've had a bad experience with a lead vendor. What specifically went wrong?"

[Let them talk—they'll reveal whether it was lead quality, speed-to-contact issues, or vendor reliability]

"So it sounds like the real issue wasn't the leads themselves—it was [their stated issue]. How did that affect your intake team?"

**Why this works:** You're labeling their pain, not defending lead gen. You're getting them to articulate the problem, which often reveals it wasn't lead quality—it was their own process issues (speed-to-contact, intake capacity, etc.).

**Then reframe:**

"Here's the difference with our model: we're not just sending leads. We're providing geo-exclusive territory. That means no race to the phone. And we work with you to optimize your intake process so you're not wasting leads."

---

#### Objection 2: "$400/lead seems expensive."

**Voss Response (Reframe to Cost Per Signed Case):**

"I hear you. $400 per lead sounds expensive—if you're comparing it to shared leads at $50-$100.

But here's the real question: What's your cost per *signed case* from your current sources?"

[Let them answer—most don't track this]

"Most firms spending on Google Ads in [NYC/Miami] are seeing $8,000-$20,000 cost per signed case. Our clients average $1,600-$2,400.

So yes, the lead costs more. But the *case* costs less. Does that math make sense to you?"

**Why this works:** You're reframing from cost-per-lead (where you lose) to cost-per-signed-case (where you win). You're also exposing that they're not tracking the right metric.

---

#### Objection 3: "We're not sure we can handle the volume."

**Voss Response (Reduce Risk + Future Pace):**

"That's actually a great problem to have. Most firms worry about not getting *enough* leads.

What if we started small—say, 10-15 leads per month—and scaled based on your intake capacity? That way you can test the quality and conversion without overwhelming your team.

If it works, we scale. If it doesn't, you're not locked into massive volume. Does that sound reasonable?"

**Why this works:** You're reducing risk (small start), showing flexibility (not forcing volume), and getting them to future-pace success ("if it works, we scale").

---

#### Objection 4: "We need to think about it."

**NEPQ Response (Create Emotional Commitment):**

"I totally understand. Before you go, I'm curious—when you say 'think about it,' what specific concerns are you still trying to work through?"

[Let them answer—this surfaces the real objection]

"Got it. So if we could address [their concern], is there anything else that would stop you from moving forward?"

[If they say "no," you've isolated the final objection]

"Okay. So if I can show you [solution to their concern], when would you be ready to make a decision?"

**Why this works:** You're not accepting "I need to think about it" at face value. You're uncovering the real objection and creating a commitment ("when would you be ready?").

---

## The Close: Assumptive + Scarcity

**When you've handled objections and they're showing buying signals, close with assumption + scarcity:**

"Great. So here's what I'm thinking:

We'll start you with [X leads/month] in [City] with exclusive territory. That means no other firm in your market gets these leads—they're yours.

I need to reserve your market now before we commit it to one of the other firms interested. Can we get you set up this week?"

**Why this works:**
- **Assumptive close:** You're assuming the sale ("here's what I'm thinking")
- **Scarcity:** You're creating urgency ("before we commit it to another firm")
- **Simple ask:** You're not asking "do you want to buy?"—you're asking "can we get you set up this week?"

---

## Whale-Specific Considerations

### For Marketing Directors (Marcus Chen Types):

- **Expect longer cycle:** 4-8 weeks, multiple stakeholders
- **Provide detailed data:** ROI models, case studies, benchmarking data
- **Integration requirements:** Ask about their CRM, case management software
- **Reporting expectations:** They'll want dashboards, regular reports, attribution

**Key Question:** "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"

---

### For Retiring Partners (Tired King Types):

- **Don't oversell complexity:** They want simple, turnkey
- **Position as exit strategy:** "Predictable case flow increases practice value"
- **Emphasize stability:** "Set it and forget it—we handle everything"
- **Respect their legacy:** "You've built something impressive over [X years]—we want to help you protect that"

**Key Question:** "What would make this decision easy for you?"

---

### For Growth-Oriented Partners (Jennifer Walsh Types):

- **Lead with competitive positioning:** "How are you differentiating from Morgan & Morgan?"
- **Show scalability:** "We can grow with you—start at 20/month, scale to 50+"
- **Build partnership narrative:** "One firm per market—you're not buying leads, you're becoming our [City] partner"
- **Future-pace growth:** "Where do you want to be in 12 months? 50 cases/month? 100?"

**Key Question:** "What's your growth target for case volume this year?"

---

## Post-Sale: Onboarding & Retention

### Week 1: Kick-Off Call
- Confirm territory exclusivity
- Set monthly lead volume target
- Review intake process and speed-to-contact optimization
- Set up reporting cadence (weekly? monthly?)

### Month 1: Performance Check-In
- Review conversion rates (leads → signed cases)
- Identify any quality issues
- Optimize intake process if needed
- Get feedback: "On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you so far?"

### Ongoing: Quarterly Business Reviews (for whales)
- Show ROI: cost per signed case vs. other channels
- Discuss scaling opportunities
- Competitive intelligence sharing
- Relationship building with managing partner

**Retention Strategy:**
The best way to retain whale clients is to **make them money and make it easy**. Track their metrics better than they do. Show them the ROI quarterly. Be proactive about optimizing their intake. Treat them like partners, not customers.

## Sales Methodology Quick Reference

| Methodology | When to Use | Key Techniques |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Chris Voss (Tactical Empathy)** | Discovery, objection handling | Calibrated questions, labeling, mirroring, accusation audit |
| **Jeremy Miner (NEPQ)** | Creating emotional commitment, closing | Scale questions (1-10), future pacing, neuro-emotional triggers |
| **Challenger Sale** | Presenting the offer | Teach them something new, reframe their thinking, challenge assumptions |
| **Gap Selling** | ROI demonstration | Current state → future state, show the cost of the gap |
| **Sandler Pain Funnel** | Deep pain discovery | "Tell me more about that," funnel down to root cause |

---

**Bottom Line:**

Whale prospects require **consultative, relationship-based selling**. You're not pushing leads—you're building partnerships. Use Voss for discovery, NEPQ for commitment, and Challenger Sale for reframing. Always anchor to cost-per-signed-case, not cost-per-lead. And close with assumption + scarcity: "Let's reserve your market before another firm takes it."

| **Podhurst Orseck** | Aaron Podhurst or Peter Prieto | → MP (boutique elite) | Partner-driven boutique, handle complex cases |
| **Leesfield & Partners** | Ira H. Leesfield | → MP (Tired King) | Founder, 50 years practice, legacy positioning |

## The Email Pattern Research

For firms where we don't have direct emails yet, try these patterns:

**Common Law Firm Email Formats:**
1. `firstname@firmname.com` (most common)
2. `firstnamelastname@firmname.com`
3. `first.last@firmname.com`
4. `flastname@firmname.com`

**Verified Patterns:**
- Gair Gair: `bbr@gairgair.com` (initials)
- Finz & Finz: `sfinz@finzfirm.com` (first initial + last name)
- Rubenstein: `rr@rubensteinlaw.com` (initials) / `mmehta@rubensteinlaw.com` (firstnamelastname)
- Boyers: `rboyers@boyerslaw.com` (first initial + last name)
- Searcy Denney: `CDS@searcylaw.com` (initials, capitalized)

**Pro Tip:** For firms with long names (Gair Gair Conason), they often shorten the domain (`gairgair.com`, not `gairgairconason.com`).

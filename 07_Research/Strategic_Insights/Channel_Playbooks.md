## Behavioral Science by Channel

Different platforms require different psychological trigger emphasis:

| Channel | Primary Trigger | Secondary Trigger | Why |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Google Search** | Intent Capture | Authority | User already searching — provide credibility |
| **TikTok/Reels** | Pattern Interrupt | Loss Aversion | User in entertainment mode — must break scroll |
| **Meta Feed** | Self-Reference | Temporal Framing | User in social context — make it personal |
| **Native Ads** | Curiosity Gap | Moral Outrage | User in reading mode — hook into story |
| **YouTube** | Authority | Transformation | User in research mode — educate and prove |

### Behavioral Creative Guidelines by Platform

| Platform | Do | Don't |
|----------|------|--------|
| TikTok | POV perspectives, pattern interrupts, lo-fi | Polished production, traditional authority |
| Meta | Before/after transformations, self-referential | Generic stock, brand-focused |
| Native | Exposé framing, curiosity hooks | Direct sales messaging |
| YouTube | Earned authority, case walkthroughs | Short-form hooks, urgency tactics |

## Channel Priority Matrix

| Channel | Priority | Volume | CPL Range | Quality | Effort |
|---------|----------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **AI SEO / GEO** | **P1 — New** | Medium | **$0 (organic)** | High | Medium (Content) |
| Meta (Facebook/IG) | P1 | Medium | $75-$150 CPL | Medium | Medium |
| TikTok/Reels | P1 Growth | High (Viral) | $80-$200 CPL | Mixed | High (Content) |
| Google Search (Long-Tail) | P2 | Low | $100-$200 CPL | High | Medium |
| Local Services Ads (LSA) | P3 | Low | Bid-based | High | Medium |
| Google Search (High-Intent) | **Cap Tightly** | Low/Capped | $300-$600+ CPL | High | High |
| Native (Taboola/Outbrain) | Out of Scope | High | $1-$5 CPC | Medium | Medium |
| YouTube | P3 | Medium | Medium CPV | High | High (Production) |

### ⚠️ Google Search High-Intent Economics

**Why high-intent Google Search doesn't work for Second Chair:**

| Our Target CPL | $100-$150 (success) to $300 (break-even) |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| High-Intent CPC | $100-$500+ per click |
| Required Conversion Rate | 50-100% (mathematically impossible) |
| Realistic Conversion Rate | 15-30% (quiz funnel) |
| Resulting CPL | $333-$667+ (way over target) |

**Strategic Response:**
1. **AI SEO / GEO** — Get cited for free on queries that cost $100-$500 per click
2. **Demand Creation** — Meta/TikTok at $10-$30 CPM creates demand we convert
3. **Long-Tail Only** — If doing Google, focus on informational/hyper-local queries ($20-$50 CPC)
4. **Cap High-Intent** — Run minimal high-intent for data only, not scale

## AI SEO / Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

> **Full strategy:** See `AI_SEO_Geo_Strategy.md`

### The Opportunity

AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) is answering the same high-intent queries that cost $100-$500+ per click on Google Search — **for free**.

| Query | Google PPC Cost | AI Citation Cost |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| "what to do after car accident Nevada" | $50-$150 | $0 |
| "car accident lawyer near me" | $200-$500+ | $0 |
| "Nevada car accident statute of limitations" | $30-$80 | $0 |

### Why This Is P1 Priority

1. **CPC Arbitrage** — Free traffic for queries we can't afford to bid on
2. **High Intent** — Users asking AI are actively seeking answers
3. **Competitor Gap** — Most PI firms fighting over PPC, not optimizing for AI
4. **Compounds Over Time** — Content that gets cited keeps getting cited

### What Gets Cited by AI

- Clear, direct answers (first paragraph answers the question)
- Structured content (headers as questions, numbered lists, tables)
- Authoritative sources (cite statutes, official sources)
- State-specific content (less competition, more relevant)
- FAQ schema markup

### Action Items

1. Create definitive "What to do after car accident in [State]" guides
2. Build FAQ content structured for AI extraction
3. Implement schema markup on all educational content
4. Monitor AI citation rate monthly (test queries in ChatGPT/Perplexity)

## Google Search (PPC)

### The Reality
- Highest-quality lead source
- **Most expensive — often incompatible with CPL targets**
- Requires rigorous management for profitability
- High-intent keywords ($100-$500+ CPC in major metros)
- **Strategy: Long-tail only, cap high-intent spend**

### The Negative Keyword Moat

**Critical Insight:** Successful PI campaigns have negative keyword lists exceeding 5,000 terms. The "negative" strategy is as important as positive targeting.

#### Standard Negatives (Starter List)
```
pro bono
free legal aid
law school
salary
job
internship
template
statute (implies research, not hiring)
example
forms
cheap
school
how to
what is
definition
```

#### Competitor Negatives
- Users searching for specific firms (e.g., "Morgan & Morgan phone number") are often existing clients
- Negating competitor names ensures budget goes to unbranded intent
- "Car accident lawyer" (up for grabs) > "Morgan & Morgan" (brand loyal)

### Performance Optimization
- **Quality Score obsession** — Landing page relevance, ad relevance, expected CTR
- **Dayparting** — Bid higher during peak hours (6-9 PM local)
- **Device bidding** — Mobile often converts differently than desktop
- **Call extensions** — Speed to lead starts at the SERP

---

## Local Services Ads (LSA)

### How LSA Differs from PPC
- Appears ABOVE traditional PPC ("Google Screened" badge)
- Ranking NOT primarily bid-based
- Reviews and Responsiveness are the ranking factors

### The Responsiveness Factor

**Critical:** Firms must answer LSA calls within SECONDS to maintain responsiveness score. Missing calls = immediate ranking drops.

### Review Velocity Strategy ⏸️ P3 — Requires Partner Firm Integration

> **Current Limitation:** LSA reviews require an active Google Business Profile for the partner law firm. As a white-label lead gen operation, Second Chair cannot directly accumulate reviews. This section is for reference when working with partner firms.

**The algorithm favors RECENT reviews over TOTAL reviews.**

| Scenario | Ranking |
|----------|---------|
| 50 reviews (5 from this week) | Higher |
| 500 reviews (last one 3 months ago) | Lower |

**Tactic (for partner firms):** Don't wait until case closes (years). Ask after intake call:
> "Did we answer your questions today? We'd appreciate a quick review of our service."

### LSA Action Items for @Head_of_Performance
1. Set up instant call routing — no rings, no voicemail ✅
2. ~~Implement review request automation post-intake~~ ⏸️ Partner firm responsibility
3. Monitor responsiveness score daily ✅
4. ~~Prioritize review velocity over review volume~~ ⏸️ Partner firm responsibility

## TikTok / Instagram Reels

### The Opportunity
- Low CPM ($10-$20) compared to search
- Algorithmic discovery reaches users before they search
- Creates demand rather than harvesting existing demand
- Viral potential for exponential reach

### The Challenge
- Low-intent audience (entertainment mode, not buying mode)
- Must "create" the need, not just answer it
- Requires high volume of content production
- Mixed lead quality (requires better qualification)

### Creative Strategy: The "Lo-Fi" Revolution

**What converts on social:**
- Smartphone-shot vertical video
- Native platform fonts and effects
- "UGC-style" over produced commercial
- Pattern interruption in first 3 seconds

**Why it works:**
- Brain categorizes polished video as "ad" → defenses up
- Brain categorizes lo-fi video as "content" → defenses down

### Broad Targeting + Creative Filtering

Due to privacy changes (cookie loss), hyper-targeting is less effective.

**New Strategy:**
1. Target broad (Age 25-55 + Geo)
2. Let the creative do the filtering
3. Video about "Motorcycle Lane Splitting" naturally reaches motorcyclists
4. Algorithm finds similar viewers

### Content Production for @Graham_Fink

**Current (AI-First):**
- Focus on Meta static imagery with behavioral science principles
- AI-generated POV perspectives, transformation imagery, situational scenes
- Test visual hooks in static format before video investment

**Future (When Creators Available):** ⏸️ P3
- Build a "UGC Studio" capability
- Daily lo-fi video output
- Test hooks aggressively (first 3 seconds = everything)
- Use native TikTok effects (Green Screen, text stickers)

### Behavioral Science Application: TikTok/Reels

| Hook Type | Behavioral Trigger | Example |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Pattern Interrupt | Cognitive disruption | Unusual camera angle, unexpected statement |
| Loss Aversion | Fear of missing out | "Don't do this after an accident..." |
| Insider Knowledge | Information asymmetry | "Insurance adjusters are trained to..." |
| Counterfactual | Regret aversion | "5 years from now, will you wish..." |
| Self-Reference | Personal relevance | "If you drive [Highway] in [City]..." |

**First 3 Seconds Formula:**
1. Visual pattern interrupt (0.5s)
2. Loss aversion hook (1.5s) 
3. Curiosity gap (1s)

---

## Meta (Facebook/Instagram)

### Special Ad Categories Reminder
All Second Chair ads = Special Ad Categories. See `05_Restrictions/Platform_Rules.md`.

### Retargeting Limitations

**Critical:** Google and Meta have strict restrictions on retargeting for sensitive categories (health/injury) to prevent privacy violations.

**Implication:** First-touch conversion is critical. The ad must pitch the value proposition immediately — you may not get a second chance.

### What Works (Current)
- Broad targeting + creative filtering (same as TikTok) ✅
- Quiz funnels over static lead forms ✅
- AI-generated behavioral science imagery (POV, transformation) ✅
- Situational/contextual imagery matching user state ✅

### What Works (Future — When Creators Available) ⏸️ P3
- Video outperforms static for scroll-stopping
- Candid photography over stock
- UGC-style creator content

### Feed vs Stories/Reels
- Feed: More text space, longer consideration
- Stories/Reels: Pattern interrupt, full screen, sound-on

---

## YouTube

### The Opportunity
- Research-mode users (higher intent than TikTok)
- Long-form education builds trust
- Pre-roll ads with "Skip" = only pay for engaged viewers
- Strong for "what to do after accident" searches

### Video Approaches

| Format | Length | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Skippable In-Stream | 12s - 3 min | General awareness |
| Non-Skippable | 15-20s | Guaranteed message delivery |
| Bumper | 6s | Frequency/reminder |
| Discovery | Any | Research-intent capture |

### Content for YouTube
- "What to do after a car accident in [State]" — evergreen
- Attorney reaction to viral dashcam footage
- "3 things insurance adjusters won't tell you"
- Case study walkthroughs (compliant, no guarantees)

## Native Advertising (Taboola/Outbrain)

> **Note:** Native advertising is primarily used for mass tort campaigns, which are **out of scope** for Second Chair. We focus on MVA only.
> 
> This section is retained for reference but is not part of current operations.

## Traditional Media Integration

### The "Air Cover" Effect
TV and billboards lift digital conversion rates. Users see billboard → remember number → Google later → branded search is cheap.

### Vanity Numbers
Memorable numbers (1-800-INJURED style) bridge offline-online gap:
1. User sees billboard/TV
2. Remembers number
3. Googles the number later
4. Branded search = cheap and high-converting

### For @Julian_Cole
- Track "branded search" lift when traditional runs
- Measure halo effect on digital CPL
- Consider vanity number licensing for Second Chair

## Channel Mix Recommendations

### P1 Channels (Always On) ✅ Active
- **AI SEO / GEO** — Free traffic for high-intent queries, major arbitrage opportunity
- **Meta** (broad + quiz funnels) — AI-generated behavioral imagery, $75-$150 CPL achievable
- **TikTok** — Demand creation, competitors aren't there, $80-$200 CPL

### P2 Channels (Selective) ✅ Active
- **Google Search (Long-Tail Only)** — Informational queries, hyper-local, $20-$50 CPC keywords
- Display networks — AI-generated situational imagery

### P3 Channels (Future / Cap Tightly)
- Google Search (High-Intent) — Cap spend, use for data/testing only, economics don't work at scale
- YouTube (education + trust) — requires video production
- LSA (trust + local) — requires partner firm review strategy
- Spotify — audio interrupt ads

### Out of Scope
- Native Advertising (Taboola/Outbrain) — primarily for mass tort, not MVA
- Mass tort aggregator partnerships

### Awareness Channels (Brand Building) — Lower Priority
- Traditional (TV, Billboard) for "air cover"

## The Math: Why This Channel Mix

| Channel | Media Cost | Conversion | CPL | Viable at $100-$150 Target? |
|---------|------------|------------|-----|----------------------------|
| AI SEO | $0 | 5-15% | $0 (content cost only) | ✅ Yes |
| Meta + Quiz | $15-30 CPM | 15-25% | $75-$150 | ✅ Yes |
| TikTok | $10-20 CPM | 10-15% | $80-$200 | ✅ Yes (at scale) |
| Google Long-Tail | $20-50 CPC | 20-30% | $100-$200 | ⚠️ Marginal |
| Google High-Intent | $100-500 CPC | 20-30% | $333-$1,500+ | ❌ No |

**Bottom Line:** Demand creation (Meta/TikTok) + AI arbitrage (GEO) is the only path to $100-$150 CPL. Google Search is for incremental volume, not scale.

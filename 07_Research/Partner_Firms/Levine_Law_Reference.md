### John Hill ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Google)
> "After being involved in a rear end accident with a drunk driver, I reached out to Levine Law for representation. From day one, minute one, I was treated with respect and as a valued client. Sarah Freedman represented me, and from our initial meeting she was professional, spoke with me, not at me; clearly managed expectations and provided guidance in language that was easy to understand. I would highly recommend the Levine Law team to anyone seeking representation."

## Testimonials — Long (Detailed stories)

### Angel Oliver ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Google)
> "My daughter was injured in a deck collapse incident. I appreciate that Andrew Phillips initially came to my house to meet with my daughter and myself and let us know its a case they could help us with. The communication was outstanding. I never had to call in; our paralegal Jenni Lesmeister was in constant contact with us and kept us in the loop as we went through the different stages. Andrew did an awesome job preparing my daughter for her deposition and mediation. One thing I appreciate is the honesty of Andrew & the Levine team. They made sure we fully understood all sides of the case so we could make the best decisions. Thank you Andrew & Jenni for all your hard work in making things right for us as my daughter went through the healing process. You allowed me to place my focus on my daughter. You guys are AWESOME!!!"

### Greg S. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Yelp)
> "I was T-Boned and my Truck totaled while traveling to Buckley AFB for work. My truck never made it home but I did with moderate injuries to my hand, shoulder and neck that lasted weeks. Being from out of state I needed someone to represent me in CO and found Levine Law online. I worked with Sarah Freedman and Jessa Boles entirely through phone and E-Mail and could not have been happier. The thing we all want when hiring a lawyer is someone who will listen to and take your case as seriously as you do. Perhaps most importantly for me I needed someone to help walk me through all the steps since it was my first real accident with injuries. The customer service I experienced with this firm I would wish every company could live up to."

### Dan and Leilan ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Testimonial)
> "In January of 2012 my husband, a firefighter of 15 years, was badly injured while on duty. The workers compensation process was a nightmare with lost income and difficulty getting proper medical treatment. Jordan Levine and his team stepped in to help when we were going through one of the most difficult times in our lives. Phone calls and emails were always returned quickly and we were always treated with understanding and respect. The firm was honest, straightforward and extremely knowledgeable about the legal process. Jordan was able to get us a settlement that has helped give us a fresh start, time to heal and peace of mind. Our family is so grateful and highly recommends Jordan Levine and Levine Law."

### Kim M. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Testimonial)
> "I just wanted to say thank you for all of your assistance in bringing a resolution to this matter. This injury has impacted my life in ways that I never could have imagined and to have some closure to at least the legal end of things brings me and my family great peace. I can't tell you how much I appreciated all of the times you answered my questions in a speedy manner or took the time to explain things I was confused about. It really did make a very scary and intimidating process seem manageable. From the moment we met I felt you thought I deserved justice and that gave me hope throughout a very difficult time in my life so again, thank you for that."

### Andrew C. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Testimonial)
> "I was hit by a car in march of 2009 while performing my regular job duties. My injuries were severe but repairable by a good Dr. I contacted several personal injury lawyers who all told me that my case was being handled the best it could be and that there was just nothing they could do for me. After being discouraged, I made one last attempt to get help and contacted Jordan Levine. Jordan Reviewed my case and discovered that not only could he help me with the work comp part of my case, but that I was also covered by my own personal insurance. Jordan has stayed with my case for over 4 years seeing me through 5 total surgeries. Jordan Levine put my opposition to shame in a court hearing and got a bad impairment rating reversed. If you feel you need help with a personal injury or work comp case call Jordan Levine, you will be glad you did."

### Avvo Reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
> "My experience with the Levine Law team was one of a very professional, knowledgeable, respectful, and trustworthy group of people. This includes Jordan Levine, Andrew Philips, Sarah Freedman, and Jenni Lesmeister. They were all easy to talk to, returned all my calls in a very timely manner, and answered most of my questions immediately. This was my first time hiring an attorney, and I was extremely concerned and nervous. Along the way, Jordan assured me he would only proceed if I wanted to, and it would be my decision to proceed or not to proceed. He allowed me to make my own decisions without any pressure. I trusted Jordan and he lived up to all he discussed with me, and I am extremely pleased that I decided to proceed. I would recommend this law firm to anyone who needs a great and honest attorney."

## Testimonials — Slip and Fall Specific

### Lawyers.com Reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
> "Sarah Freedman and Levine Law were outstanding in providing me legal services in my slip and fall case. I highly recommend Sarah to anyone seeking justice concerning personal injury. From the start she quickly put my mind at ease and worked diligently to a successful resolution. Though I wish the fall and broken hip never happened, I felt what I received more than compensated for my pain and suffering. I HIGHLY recommend Sarah and Levine Law to anyone requiring personal injury legal services."

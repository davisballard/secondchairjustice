# Section 1: RESPONSIVE SEARCH ADS - HEADLINES (Insight Hub)

Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) allow up to 15 headlines that Google's algorithm mixes and matches to find winning combinations.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Headlines available** | Up to 15 | Google recommends providing all 15 |
| **Character limit** | 30 characters each | Strict limit, no truncation |
| **Displayed at once** | Up to 3 | Google selects based on context |
| **Pinning** | Optional | Can pin headlines to positions 1, 2, or 3 |

---

## The 30-Character Challenge

Unlike Meta's longer text fields, Google headlines force extreme brevity. Every character counts.

### Character-Efficient Techniques

| Technique | Example | Characters |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Abbreviations** | "Atty" instead of "Attorney" | Saves 4 |
| **Symbols** | "&" instead of "and" | Saves 2 |
| **Numbers** | "24/7" instead of "Twenty-four seven" | Saves 13 |
| **Contractions** | "Don't" instead of "Do not" | Saves 3 |

### Second Chair Headline Examples (Under 30 chars)

| Headline | Characters | Type |
|----------|------------|------|
| "Car Accident? Free Review" | 25 | Problem + Offer |
| "No Fee Unless You Win" | 21 | Risk Reversal |
| "Speak to an Attorney Today" | 26 | Action + Urgency |
| "Get Compensation Help Now" | 25 | Benefit + Urgency |
| "Free Case Evaluation" | 20 | Clear Offer |
| "Experienced Injury Attorneys" | 28 | Authority |
| "Cases Being Accepted" | 20 | Status |
| "Legal Options Available" | 23 | Availability |

---

## Headline Strategy for RSAs

### The 15-Headline Framework

Google recommends variety. Structure your 15 headlines across these categories:

| Category | # of Headlines | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|----------------|---------|----------|
| **Keyword-Focused** | 3-4 | Match search intent | "Car Accident Attorney", "Personal Injury Help" |
| **Benefit/Outcome** | 3-4 | What they get | "Get Compensation", "Protect Your Rights" |
| **Authority/Trust** | 2-3 | Build credibility | "Experienced Attorneys", "Trusted Legal Team" |
| **Offer/Value** | 2-3 | Clear value prop | "Free Consultation", "No Upfront Fees" |
| **Action/CTA** | 2-3 | Drive clicks | "Call Now", "Get Help Today", "Speak to a Lawyer" |

### Pinning Strategy

> **Stat:** Over-pinning reduces ad performance. Google recommends minimal pinning to allow algorithm optimization.

| Pin Position | Best Use | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Position 1** | Brand or primary keyword | "Car Accident Cases" |
| **Position 2** | Differentiator or offer | "Free Case Review" |
| **Position 3** | CTA or urgency (optional) | "Call Now" |

**Second Chair Recommendation:** Pin only 1-2 headlines maximum. Let Google optimize the rest.

---

## Headline Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Evidence |
|-----|-----|----------|
| **Include keywords in at least 3 headlines** | Improves Quality Score and ad relevance | Keywords in headlines improve CTR by 15-20% |
| **Create headlines that work in any combination** | Google mixes them dynamically | Avoid headlines that only make sense together |
| **Use numbers and specifics** | Increases credibility | "500+ Cases Handled" > "Many Cases Handled" |
| **Include location if relevant** | Improves local relevance | "[City] Injury Attorneys" |
| **Test emotional vs. logical** | Different searchers respond differently | Create both types |
| **Avoid repetition across headlines** | Wastes valuable slots | Each headline should add unique value |

---

## Ad Strength Optimization

Google rates RSA "Ad Strength" from Poor to Excellent. Aim for "Good" or "Excellent."

### How to Improve Ad Strength

- Use all 15 headline slots
- Include keywords in headlines
- Make headlines unique (not repetitive)
- Use all 4 description slots
- Include keywords in descriptions

> **Note:** Ad Strength is a guideline, not a guarantee of performance. A "Good" ad with relevant messaging can outperform an "Excellent" ad with weak copy.

---

# Section 2: RESPONSIVE SEARCH ADS - DESCRIPTIONS (Insight Hub)

Descriptions provide supporting detail and expand on the headline promise.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Descriptions available** | Up to 4 | Google recommends providing all 4 |
| **Character limit** | 90 characters each | More room to elaborate |
| **Displayed at once** | Up to 2 | Google selects based on context |

---

## The 90-Character Opportunity

Descriptions allow more detailed messaging than headlines. Use this space strategically.

### Description Structure

**Formula:** Benefit + Proof/Detail + CTA

| Element | Characters | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Benefit | ~30 | "Get the compensation you deserve." |
| Proof/Detail | ~35 | "Experienced attorneys. No upfront fees." |
| CTA | ~20 | "Free case review today." |

### Second Chair Description Examples

| Description | Characters | Elements |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| "Accident victims may be entitled to compensation. Speak with an experienced attorney today." | 89 | Benefit + CTA |
| "No fee unless we win your case. Free consultation with licensed attorneys. Call now." | 83 | Risk reversal + Offer + CTA |
| "Experienced legal team handling car accident cases. Get a free case evaluation today." | 85 | Authority + Offer + CTA |
| "Settlements in similar cases have reached significant amounts. See if you qualify." | 80 | Social proof + CTA |

---

## Description Strategy

### The 4-Description Framework

| Description # | Focus | Example |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| **Description 1** | Primary value proposition | Main benefit + what makes you different |
| **Description 2** | Risk reversal / Trust | No fees, guarantees, experience |
| **Description 3** | Process / Next steps | What happens when they click/call |
| **Description 4** | Urgency / Secondary benefit | Time limits, availability |

---

## Description Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Evidence |
|-----|-----|----------|
| **Include a CTA in each description** | Drives action regardless of which shows | Descriptions with CTAs have higher conversion rates |
| **Mirror landing page language** | Improves Quality Score | Message match reduces bounce rate |
| **Use complete sentences** | Reads more professionally | Fragments can feel rushed/cheap |
| **Include keywords naturally** | Improves relevance score | Bold keywords in search results |
| **Address objections** | Reduces friction | "No upfront fees" overcomes cost concerns |
| **Be specific about outcomes** | Builds credibility | "Settlements in similar cases..." |

---

# Section 3: DISPLAY PATH (Insight Hub)

The display path appears as part of the visible URL and can reinforce your message.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Path fields** | 2 | Appear after domain |
| **Character limit** | 15 characters each | Short keyword opportunities |
| **Display format** | domain.com/Path1/Path2 | Visible to users |

---

## Display Path Strategy

The display path is often overlooked but provides additional keyword/message real estate.

### Effective Display Paths for Second Chair

| Car-Accident | Free-Review | secondchair.com/Car-Accident/Free-Review | MVA campaigns |

---

## Display Path Tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| **Include primary keyword** | Reinforces relevance |
| **Use hyphens for readability** | "Car-Accident" reads better than "CarAccident" |
| **Match ad group theme** | Consistency improves Quality Score |
| **Include offer if space allows** | "Free-Review" adds value |

---

# Section 4: DISPLAY NETWORK COPY (Insight Hub)

Display ads appear across Google's network of websites, requiring different copy strategies than search.

---

## Specifications (Responsive Display Ads)

| Element | Limit | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Short Headlines** | Up to 5, 30 chars each | Like RSA headlines |
| **Long Headline** | 1, 90 characters | More descriptive |
| **Descriptions** | Up to 5, 90 chars each | Supporting copy |
| **Business Name** | 25 characters | Second Chair branding |

---

## Display vs. Search: Key Differences

| Aspect | Search Ads | Display Ads |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **User intent** | Active (searching for solution) | Passive (browsing) |
| **Copy goal** | Answer their query | Interrupt and intrigue |
| **Tone** | Direct, informative | More attention-grabbing |
| **CTA strength** | Can be direct | Often softer/educational |

---

## Display Ad Copy Strategy

### Attention-First Approach

Display users aren't actively searching. Your copy must:

1. **Stop the scroll** — Pattern interrupt or emotional hook
2. **Create relevance** — Why should they care?
3. **Offer value** — What do they get?
4. **Drive action** — Clear next step

### Long Headline (90 chars)

Use the full 90 characters for a complete, compelling message.

| Long Headline Example | Characters |
|-----------------------|------------|
| "Injured in an Accident? Find Out If You May Be Entitled to Compensation. Free Case Review." | 90 |
| "Car Accident Cases Being Accepted. Speak With an Experienced Attorney at No Upfront Cost." | 89 |
| "Don't Face Insurance Companies Alone. Get Legal Help Today. Free Consultation Available." | 87 |

---

## Display Copy Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Evidence |
|-----|-----|----------|
| **Use the long headline fully** | More real estate = more message | Long headlines often outperform short ones in display |
| **Include emotional triggers** | Display requires interruption | Emotional copy gets more attention |
| **Use "you" language (carefully)** | Creates personal relevance | Must remain compliant with Second Chair rules |
| **Include clear value proposition** | Users need a reason to click | "Free" and "No cost" perform well |
| **Match creative to copy** | Visual and text should reinforce each other | Mismatched ads underperform |

---

# Section 5: YOUTUBE AD COPY (Insight Hub)

YouTube ads require copy for companion banners and overlay text.

---

## Specifications

| Ad Type | Copy Elements | Key Consideration |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Skippable In-Stream** | Companion banner + CTA | First 5 seconds critical |
| **Non-Skippable** | Companion banner + CTA | Full attention, concise message |
| **Bumper** | Companion banner only | 6 seconds, one message only |
| **Discovery** | Headline + Description (2 lines) | Thumbnail + copy must work together |

---

## Video Script Considerations

While this guide focuses on text copy, video scripts should follow the same principles:

### First 5 Seconds (Critical)

> **Stat:** 65% of viewers skip after 5 seconds. The hook must land immediately.

| Hook Type | Example Opening |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Question** | "Were you injured in an accident?" |
| **Statement** | "Insurance companies don't want you to know this..." |
| **Authority** | "As a personal injury attorney, I see this mistake every day..." |

---

## YouTube Companion Banner Copy

The companion banner appears next to or below the video.

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Headline** | Match video message; clear CTA |
| **CTA** | "Learn More" / "Get Help Now" |
| **Consistency** | Banner should reinforce video, not compete |

---

# Section 6: UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES (Cross-Cutting Insights)

Techniques and principles that apply across all Google Ads formats.

---

## Intent Matching

The fundamental difference between Google and Meta: Google users are actively searching.

### Search Intent Categories

| Intent Type | Example Query | Copy Approach |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Informational** | "what to do after car accident" | Educational, helpful |
| **Navigational** | "personal injury lawyer near me" | Direct, location-focused |
| **Transactional** | "free car accident lawyer consultation" | Offer-focused, action-oriented |
| **Commercial Investigation** | "best car accident attorney reviews" | Trust signals, social proof |

> **Key Insight:** Match your copy to the search intent. Transactional queries should have strong CTAs; informational queries should offer value.

---

## Quality Score Optimization

Quality Score directly impacts cost-per-click and ad position.

### Copy Elements That Improve Quality Score

| Element | How to Optimize |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Keyword relevance** | Include target keywords in headlines and descriptions |
| **Ad relevance** | Ensure copy directly answers the search query |
| **Landing page experience** | Copy should match landing page messaging |
| **Expected CTR** | Compelling copy with clear value proposition |

---

## Keyword Insertion

Dynamic Keyword Insertion (DKI) can improve relevance but use carefully.

### When to Use

- High-volume ad groups with related keywords
- When keyword variations are similar in meaning

### When NOT to Use

- Small ad groups with diverse keywords
- When insertion could create awkward phrasing
- In Second Chair's case: Avoid DKI that could insert non-compliant language

---

## Case and Formatting

### Google Ads Capitalization Rules

| Element | Recommended | Avoid |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Headlines** | Title Case | ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation |
| **Descriptions** | Sentence case | Random capitalization |
| **Display Path** | Title-Case or lowercase | ALL CAPS |

> **Policy Note:** Google prohibits excessive capitalization, repeated punctuation, and symbols used for attention-grabbing.

---

## Character Efficiency

Every character counts in Google Ads.

### Space-Saving Techniques

| Full Phrase | Shorter Version | Savings |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| "and" | "&" | 2 chars |
| "Attorney" | "Atty" | 4 chars |
| "Consultation" | "Consult" | 6 chars |
| "Available" | "Avail." | 5 chars |
| "Information" | "Info" | 7 chars |

### Use Numbers

| Written | Numeric | Savings |
|---------|---------|---------|
| "Twenty-four hours" | "24 hours" | 11 chars |
| "Five hundred" | "500" | 9 chars |
| "One hundred percent" | "100%" | 15 chars |

---

## Testing Framework

### What to Test in Google Ads

| Variable | Test Variations |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Headlines** | Benefit-focused vs. feature-focused |
| **Descriptions** | Long-form vs. short punchy |
| **CTAs** | Soft ("Learn More") vs. hard ("Call Now") |
| **Keywords in copy** | With vs. without |
| **Numbers/stats** | With vs. without |
| **Urgency** | With vs. without |

### Testing Best Practices

- Run tests for at least 2 weeks for statistical significance
- Test one variable at a time when possible
- Use Google's ad variations feature for controlled testing
- Focus on conversion rate, not just CTR

---

## Second Chair Compliance in Google Ads

### Third-Person Language

Same rules apply as Meta:

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use |
|---------|--------|
| "Were you injured?" | "Injury cases being accepted" |
| "You deserve compensation" | "Compensation may be available" |
| "Call if you were hurt" | "Speak with an attorney today" |

### Google-Specific Policies for Legal

| Policy | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Legal services** | Cannot misrepresent who you are |
| **Lead gen** | Must be clear you're not a law firm |
| **Guarantees** | Cannot promise outcomes |
| **Targeting** | Cannot target based on health conditions |

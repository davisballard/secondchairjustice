# Section 1: AD TEXT / CAPTION (Insight Hub)

The ad text appears as the caption below your video. It's the primary written copy element.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Character limit** | 100 characters | Very tight - every character counts |
| **Visibility** | Immediately visible | No "See More" truncation |
| **Placement** | Below video, above CTA | Competes with video for attention |

---

## The 100-Character Challenge

TikTok's ad text is extremely limited. This requires maximum efficiency.

### Character-Efficient Techniques

| Technique | Example | Characters |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Abbreviations** | "Atty" vs "Attorney" | Saves 4 |
| **Symbols** | "&" vs "and" | Saves 2 |
| **Numbers** | "24/7" vs "around the clock" | Saves 12 |
| **Hashtags** | #CarAccident | Adds discoverability + context |

---

## What Works in TikTok Captions

### The Caption's Job

Unlike Meta or Google, TikTok captions are secondary to video content. The video does the heavy lifting.

**Caption purposes:**
1. **Reinforce the video hook** — Echo what's said in first 3 seconds
2. **Add context** — Location, case type, urgency
3. **Drive action** — Direct to link/bio
4. **Add discoverability** — Hashtags

### Caption Formula for Second Chair

**Structure:** Hook Reinforcement + CTA + Hashtags

| Element | Characters | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Hook Reinforcement | ~50 | "Insurance adjusters won't tell you this." |
| CTA | ~25 | "Link in bio for free case review." |
| Hashtags | ~20 | "#CarAccident #LegalTips" |

### Second Chair Caption Examples

| Caption | Characters | Elements |
|---------|------------|----------|
| "Insurance companies have lawyers. Shouldn't you? Link in bio. #CarAccident" | 75 | David vs Goliath + CTA + Tag |
| "Stop! Don't sign that check. Free case review in bio. #InjuryLawyer" | 68 | Warning hook + CTA + Tag |
| "What they don't tell you after a wreck. Link in bio. #LegalAdvice" | 66 | Curiosity + CTA + Tag |
| "3 things to never do after an accident. Bio link. #PersonalInjury" | 67 | Number hook + CTA + Tag |

---

## Caption Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Evidence |
|-----|-----|----------|
| **Mirror the video hook** | Creates consistency; reinforces message | Users who read caption should see same message |
| **Keep it conversational** | TikTok is casual | Corporate language feels out of place |
| **Include a CTA** | Captions are where the click happens | "Link in bio" is TikTok standard |
| **Use 2-3 relevant hashtags** | Improves discoverability | Don't overstuff - looks spammy |
| **Front-load the message** | First words matter most | Key info at the start |

### Hashtags That Work for Second Chair

| Category | Hashtags |
|----------|----------|
| **Injury Type** | #CarAccident #MotorcycleAccident #TruckAccident |
| **Legal** | #LegalAdvice #LawyerTok #InjuryLawyer #PersonalInjury |
| **Location** | #[State]Lawyer #[City]Attorney |
| **Educational** | #LegalTips #KnowYourRights #InsuranceTips |

---

# Section 2: VIDEO HOOKS - FIRST 3 SECONDS (Insight Hub)

The first 3 seconds are the single most important element of any TikTok ad. If the hook fails, everything else is irrelevant.

---

## The 3-Second Rule

> **Stat:** 65%+ of viewers skip after the first 3-5 seconds. The hook determines everything.

### What Must Happen in First 3 Seconds

1. **Pattern interrupt** — Break the scroll
2. **Qualify the viewer** — Signal who this is for
3. **Create curiosity** — Give reason to keep watching

---

## High-Performing Hook Archetypes

Based on Second Chair's internal research and PI marketing best practices:

### 1. The "STOP" Hook (Loss Aversion)

**Pattern:** Command + Warning

| Example | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Stop! If you were in a wreck in [City], do NOT sign the first check." | Triggers loss aversion; creates urgency |
| "Stop scrolling if you've been in an accident in the last 2 years." | Pattern interrupt + qualifying |

> **Stat:** Loss-framed hooks consistently outperform gain-framed in PI marketing.

---

### 2. The "INSIDER" Hook (Authority via Negation)

**Pattern:** Authority statement + Insider knowledge

| Example | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "I'm a lawyer and here are 3 things I would NEVER do after a crash." | "NEVER" implies insider knowledge; positions as authority |
| "Insurance adjusters are trained to say this. Here's what they don't tell you..." | Creates information asymmetry |

---

### 3. The "INCREDULOUS" Hook (Curiosity)

**Pattern:** Disbelief + Revelation tease

| Example | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "I literally cannot believe insurance adjusters get away with this..." | Triggers curiosity; feels like eavesdropping |
| "I can't believe they told my client THIS after his accident..." | Personal story angle |

---

### 4. The "MYTH BUSTER" Hook (Knowledge Gap)

**Pattern:** Common belief + Contradiction

| Example | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Everyone thinks if you rear-end someone, it's automatically your fault. Wrong." | Challenges assumed knowledge |
| "Think you can't sue if you were partially at fault? Think again." | Myth + bust in one |
| "Uber said it wasn't their problem? Here's what they're not telling you..." | Platform-specific myth busting |

---

### 5. The "VISUAL" Hook (Pattern Interrupt)

**Pattern:** Unexpected visual + Reaction

| Example | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| [Start with dashcam footage, then attorney reaction] | Visual novelty breaks scroll trance |
| [Green Screen over news article about local accident] | News credibility + commentary |
| [Extreme close-up of airbag deployment] | Visceral, attention-grabbing |

---

## Hook Formula Framework

**The Asymmetric Information Formula:**

```
[What they know] + [What they don't know] + [Revelation tease]
```

> "Insurance adjusters are trained to seem helpful. But their job is to pay you less. Here's what they won't tell you..."

This activates:
- Threat detection (they're working against you)
- Curiosity gap (what don't I know?)
- Authority positioning (lawyer as insider)

---

## Hook Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Evidence |
|-----|-----|----------|
| **Say something in the first second** | Silence loses viewers | Audio engagement is critical on TikTok |
| **Use motion immediately** | Static openings fail | TikTok is motion-first |
| **Text overlay the hook** | Many watch without sound initially | Reinforces audio message |
| **Make a bold statement** | Safe statements get scrolled past | Controversy (within reason) stops thumbs |
| **Look directly at camera** | Creates connection | POV content outperforms |

---

# Section 3: TEXT OVERLAYS (Insight Hub)

Text overlays appear on the video itself and are crucial for TikTok engagement.

---

## Text Overlay Best Practices

### Style Requirements

| Aspect | Best Practice | Why |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| **Font** | Use TikTok's native fonts | Polished fonts = ad = skip |
| **Placement** | Safe zones only (avoid top 14%, bottom 20%) | UI elements cover these areas |
| **Size** | Large enough to read on mobile | TikTok is 100% mobile |
| **Animation** | Use native TikTok animations | Matches organic content feel |

### What to Put in Text Overlays

| Overlay Purpose | Example | Placement |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| **Hook Reinforcement** | "DON'T sign that check" | First 1-3 seconds |
| **Key Point Emphasis** | "Insurance adjusters are NOT your friend" | When point is made verbally |
| **CTA** | "Link in bio" | Final 5 seconds |
| **Authority** | "Personal Injury Attorney" | Throughout (lower third) |

---

## Text Overlay Specific Tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| **Don't overload** | Too much text = overwhelming = skip |
| **One idea per overlay** | Clarity over density |
| **Match audio timing** | Text should appear as words are spoken |
| **Use contrast** | White text on busy backgrounds gets lost |
| **Keep it casual** | Proper grammar optional (matches platform) |

---

# Section 4: CTA BUTTON (Insight Hub)

The CTA button is the action driver on TikTok ads.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Display Name** | 20 characters | Customizable call-to-action |
| **Button Options** | Standard set | Learn More, Sign Up, Contact Us, etc. |

---

## Button Selection for Second Chair

| Campaign Goal | Recommended Button | Why |
|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Lead Generation** | "Learn More" | Low commitment, curiosity-driven |
| **Quiz Funnel** | "Learn More" | Soft entry point |
| **Direct Contact** | "Contact Us" | When targeting warm traffic |

> **Second Chair Recommendation:** "Learn More" for cold traffic. The goal is to get them to the quiz funnel, not commit immediately.

---

## Display Name Examples

The display name appears above the CTA button.

| Display Name | Characters | Focus |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| "Free Case Review" | 16 | Offer clarity |
| "See If You Qualify" | 17 | Curiosity + qualifying |
| "Get Legal Help Now" | 18 | Action + urgency |
| "Claim Your Estimate" | 19 | Value-focused |

---

## CTA Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Evidence |
|-----|-----|----------|
| **Match CTA to video content** | Mismatched CTAs confuse | Consistency improves conversion |
| **Reinforce CTA verbally** | Say "link in bio" in video | Audio + visual + button = 3x exposure |
| **End with CTA visible** | Last frame should show CTA | Final impression drives action |
| **Don't oversell** | TikTok users resist hard sells | Soft CTAs outperform on platform |

---

# Section 5: VIDEO SCRIPT STRUCTURE (Insight Hub)

While this guide focuses on copy, video scripts need structure to convert.

---

## The 30-Second Template

```
0:00-0:03 (HOOK): 
"[Insider/Stop/Incredulous hook]"

0:03-0:15 (EDUCATION): 
"[Third-person explainer about the issue]"

0:15-0:25 (AUTHORITY): 
"[Personal experience or case example]"

0:25-0:30 (CTA): 
"[Call to action]. Link in bio."
```

### Example Script (Second Chair Compliant)

```
0:00-0:03 (HOOK):
"Stop! Don't sign that first check from the insurance company."

0:03-0:15 (EDUCATION):
"Most people don't realize that first offer is almost always 
way lower than what the case is actually worth. Insurance 
adjusters are trained to close fast and pay less."

0:15-0:25 (AUTHORITY):
"I've seen cases where victims accepted $5,000 when similar 
cases settled for ten times that amount."

0:25-0:30 (CTA):
"Free case review in my bio. See what your case could be worth."
```

---

## The "Dual Creator" Format

Split-screen or cut-sequence with two roles:

**Person A (Naive Statement):**
- "The insurance company said I was 50% at fault so I can't sue."
- "Uber said it wasn't their problem because the driver was an independent contractor."
- "I was told I missed the deadline to file."

**Person B (Lawyer Correction):**
- "That's not how comparative negligence works. You can still recover..."
- "That's exactly what rideshare companies want you to believe. Here's the truth..."
- "Statutes of limitations are complicated. Let me explain..."

> **Why It Works:** Mimics conversation. Feels like eavesdropping on helpful advice rather than receiving a lecture.

---

# Section 6: UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES (Cross-Cutting Insights)

Techniques and principles that apply across all TikTok ad copy.

---

## Authenticity is Everything

> **Key Insight:** TikTok's algorithm and users both punish polished, corporate content. Native wins.

### What "Native" Means

| Native (Do This) | Corporate (Avoid This) |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Shot on phone | Shot on professional camera |
| Natural lighting | Studio lighting |
| Casual attire | Suits and formal wear |
| TikTok fonts | Burnt-in professional subtitles |
| Raw audio | Over-produced audio |
| First-person POV | Third-person corporate |
| Imperfect delivery | Scripted perfection |

---

## Sound Strategy

> **TikTok is a sound-on platform.** Unlike Meta where 85% watch muted, TikTok users expect audio.

### Audio Best Practices

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Voice** | Speak to camera, conversational |
| **Music** | Trending sounds when appropriate (careful with legal) |
| **Captions** | Still include for accessibility |
| **Opening** | Start talking immediately |

---

## Format-Specific Best Practices

### In-Feed Video Ads

| Aspect | Best Practice |
|--------|---------------|
| **Duration** | 15-30 seconds optimal |
| **Orientation** | 9:16 vertical ONLY |
| **Hook timing** | Within first 1-3 seconds |
| **CTA timing** | Final 5 seconds |

### Spark Ads (Boosted Organic)

| Aspect | Best Practice |
|--------|---------------|
| **Source** | Best-performing organic content |
| **Authenticity** | Highest performer - already proven |
| **Caption** | Can be edited for ad purposes |

### Carousel Ads

| Aspect | Best Practice |
|--------|---------------|
| **Use case** | Educational content, step-by-step |
| **Cards** | 2-10 images |
| **Copy** | Each card should have clear message |

---

## Emoji and Formatting

### TikTok Emoji Usage

| Guideline | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Use sparingly in caption** | TikTok captions are already casual |
| **Match platform tone** | Common emojis are fine |
| **Avoid in text overlays** | Can look cluttered |
| **Legal services caveat** | Keep professional despite platform casualness |

### Capitalization on TikTok

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Captions** | Sentence case, casual |
| **Text overlays** | Can use caps for emphasis |
| **ALL CAPS** | Okay for single words ("STOP", "DON'T") |

---

## Second Chair Compliance on TikTok

### Required Disclosures

- "Attorney Advertising" disclosure in caption
- No specific dollar guarantees
- Third-person language for claims

### Third-Person Language Still Applies

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use |
|---------|--------|
| "Were you injured?" | "Accident victims may be entitled..." |
| "You deserve compensation" | "Compensation may be available..." |
| "Call if you were hurt" | "Cases are being accepted" |

### Visual Restrictions

- No blood/injury imagery
- No distressed faces
- Recovery/hope themes only

---

## Testing Framework

### What to Test on TikTok

| Variable | Test Variations |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Hook type** | Stop vs. Insider vs. Myth Buster |
| **Hook delivery** | Straight to camera vs. green screen |
| **Video length** | 15 sec vs. 30 sec vs. 60 sec |
| **Caption style** | Question vs. statement |
| **CTA wording** | "Link in bio" vs. "Free case review in bio" |

### TikTok-Specific Metrics

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Watch time** | Algorithm prioritizes completion |
| **Hook rate** | % watching past 3 seconds |
| **Engagement** | Likes, comments, shares |
| **Click-through** | Link clicks from bio |

---

## Quick Reference: TikTok Specs Summary

| Element | Limit | Best Practice |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **Ad Text (Caption)** | 100 chars | Hook + CTA + 2-3 hashtags |
| **Display Name** | 20 chars | Clear offer or curiosity |
| **CTA Button** | Standard options | "Learn More" for lead gen |
| **Video Length** | 5-60 sec | 15-30 sec optimal |
| **Hook Timing** | First 3 sec | Pattern interrupt + qualify |

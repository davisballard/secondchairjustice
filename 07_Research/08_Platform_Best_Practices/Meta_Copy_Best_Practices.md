# Section 1: PRIMARY TEXT (Insight Hub)

The primary text is the most critical copy element—it's where the hook lives and where scroll-stopping happens.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Visible limit** | ~125 characters | Before "See More" truncation on mobile |
| **Full limit** | 2,200 characters | But most users never expand |
| **Mobile reality** | First 1-2 lines | This is ALL that matters |

---

## The Hook (First 125 Characters)

This is the only copy most users will ever see. It must stop the scroll AND qualify the reader in the same breath.

### Why the Hook Matters

> **Stat:** The hook determines 80% of whether someone stops scrolling. (Reddit r/FacebookAds consensus across multiple threads)

- Users scroll at ~1.7 seconds per post
- If the first line doesn't grab them, the rest is irrelevant
- The hook must work BEFORE "See More" truncation

### The Dual Job of the Hook

1. **Stop the scroll** — Pattern interrupt, curiosity, or emotional trigger
2. **Qualify the reader** — Signal who this is for without using banned "you" + injury language

---

## Hook Formulas That Work

| Formula | Example | Why It Works | Second Chair Compliant? |
|---------|---------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Loss Aversion Command** | "Stop! Don't sign the first check from the insurance company." | Triggers fear of losing something; activates threat detection | ✅ Yes |
| **Insider Knowledge** | "Insurance adjusters are trained to say this. Here's what they don't tell you..." | Creates curiosity gap; positions attorney as insider | ✅ Yes |
| **Myth Buster** | "Everyone thinks rear-ending someone = automatic fault. Wrong." | Challenges assumed knowledge; triggers "I need to know" response | ✅ Yes |
| **Third-Person Problem** | "Accident victims often don't realize they're leaving money on the table." | Compliant + empathetic; loss framing | ✅ Yes |
| **The Incredulous** | "I literally cannot believe insurance adjusters get away with this..." | Curiosity through disbelief; feels like eavesdropping | ✅ Yes |
| **Visual Pattern Interrupt** | [Start with dashcam footage, then attorney reaction] | Breaks scroll trance through visual novelty | ✅ Yes (video) |

### Hook Formula for Second Chair

**Structure:** [What they know] + [What they don't know] + [Revelation teaser]

> "Insurance adjusters are trained to seem helpful. But their job is to pay you less. Here's what they won't tell you..."

This activates:
- Threat detection (they're working against you)
- Curiosity gap (what don't I know?)
- Authority positioning (lawyer as insider)

---

## Structure and Pacing

### The Primary Text Formula

```
Hook (first 125 chars)
↓
Education/Benefit (next 1-2 sentences)
↓
Soft CTA (final line)
```

### Pacing Principles

| Principle | Why | Stat/Evidence |
|-----------|-----|---------------|
| **Short sentences** | Mobile screens are narrow; dense text gets skipped | Short, scannable copy outperforms dense paragraphs on mobile (multiple agency studies) |
| **Line breaks** | Create visual breathing room; easier to scan | Users scan, not read—line breaks guide the eye |
| **Front-load value** | Users may never read past line 1 | First 125 chars are the only guaranteed real estate |
| **One idea per sentence** | Clarity over cleverness | Confused readers don't click |

### Example Structure (Compliant)

```
Accident victims often leave money on the table.        ← Hook (loss framing)

Insurance companies have teams of lawyers.              ← Education  
Their job is to pay as little as possible.

See if a case qualifies for compensation.               ← Soft CTA
```

---

## Tone and Voice

### The Voice Spectrum

| ❌ Avoid: "Aggressive Dog" | ✅ Use: "Protector/Guide" |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| "We FIGHT for you" | "We're here to help navigate this" |
| "Bulldog attorneys" | "Experienced advocates" |
| "We'll destroy them" | "We handle the insurance companies" |
| Combative, aggressive | Empathetic, authoritative |

> **Insight:** The victim is vulnerable—they want a guide, not a gladiator. "Protector/Guide" voice consistently outperforms "Aggressive Dog" in PI marketing.

### Third-Person Language (Required)

All Second Chair copy must use third-person language per [`Third_Person_Rules.md`](../03_Voice/Third_Person_Rules.md).

| ❌ Banned | ✅ Approved |
|-----------|------------|
| "Are you injured?" | "Accident victims may be entitled to compensation" |
| "Were you in a crash?" | "Car accident cases are being accepted" |
| "You deserve compensation" | "Compensation may be available for qualifying cases" |

---

## Word Choice

### Loss Framing vs. Benefit Framing

> **Stat:** Loss-framed messaging consistently outperforms gain-framed messaging in personal injury marketing. (Behavioral science research + PI marketing case studies)

| ❌ Benefit Frame (Weaker) | ✅ Loss Frame (Stronger) |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| "Get compensation" | "Don't lose your right to compensation" |
| "We fight for you" | "They're fighting against you. We level the field." |
| "Free consultation" | "Find out what you might be missing" |
| "Maximize your settlement" | "Don't leave money on the table" |
| "We can help" | "Don't handle this alone against their team" |

### Power Words (Compliant)

These words are safe and high-performing:

| Word | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Entitled** | "May be entitled to compensation" |
| **Qualify** | "See if you qualify" |
| **Options** | "Know your legal options" |
| **Rights** | "Protect your rights" |
| **Review** | "Free case review" |
| **Evaluation** | "Free case evaluation" |

### Words to Avoid

See [`Banned_Phrases.md`](../03_Voice/Banned_Phrases.md) for full list. Key patterns:

- "You" + injury/condition → REJECT
- "You" + deserve/owed/entitled → REJECT
- Any specific dollar guarantee → REJECT
- "Recommend" or "best" → REJECT

---

## Primary Text Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Stat/Evidence |
|-----|-----|---------------|
| **Supply 3 variants (short/medium/long)** | Meta's algorithm will optimize delivery to the best performer | Jon Loomer recommends multiple length variants for algorithm optimization |
| **Refresh hooks every 5-7 days** | Hooks burn out; creative fatigue is real | Ad fatigue sets in around frequency 2.5+ |
| **One CTA only** | Multiple CTAs confuse and reduce conversion | Single-message ads consistently outperform multi-CTA ads (Reddit PPC consensus) |
| **Test loss vs. benefit framing** | Different audiences respond differently | Loss framing generally wins for PI, but test |
| **Match copy to funnel stage** | Cold = education; Warm = social proof; Hot = urgency | Funnel-matched copy converts higher |

---

# Section 2: HEADLINE (Insight Hub)

The headline is bold, prominent text that reinforces your hook or delivers standalone value.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Feed display** | ~27 characters | Visible before truncation in most feed placements |
| **Some placements** | Up to 40-55 characters | Stories, some desktop placements |
| **Safe target** | 25-30 characters | For mobile safety across all placements |
| **Word count** | ~5 words | Optimal for readability |

---

## Purpose and Function

The headline has two possible jobs:

1. **Reinforce the primary text hook** — Double down on the message
2. **Deliver standalone value** — Work independently if primary text isn't read

> **Key insight:** The headline should make sense even if the primary text isn't read. Some placements show headline more prominently than primary text.

---

## What Makes Headlines Convert

| Principle | Example | Why It Works |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Benefit-first** | "Compensation May Be Available" | Leads with what they get |
| **Specific > Vague** | "Car Accident Cases" > "Legal Help" | Specificity signals relevance |
| **Emotional trigger** | "Know Your Rights" | Activates protection instinct |
| **Concrete value** | "Free Case Review" | Clear value exchange |

> **Stat:** Headlines under 5 words (~25-30 characters) perform best for readability and impact. (Multiple agency testing reports)

---

## Headline Formulas

| Formula | Example | Char Count | Second Chair Compliant? |
|---------|---------|------------|------------------------|
| **Case Type + Status** | "Car Accident Cases Being Accepted" | 34 | ✅ Yes |
| **Outcome + Qualifier** | "Compensation May Be Available" | 29 | ✅ Yes |
| **Question (compliant)** | "Motorcycle Crash? Know Your Rights." | 35 | ✅ Yes |
| **Authority Statement** | "Experienced Attorneys Standing By" | 33 | ✅ Yes |
| **Number + Insight** | "3 Things to Know After a Crash" | 30 | ✅ Yes |
| **Action + Benefit** | "See If You Qualify Today" | 24 | ✅ Yes |

### Headlines by Injury Type

| Type | Headline Example |
|------|------------------|
| **Car Accident** | "Car Accident Cases Being Accepted" |
| **Motorcycle** | "Motorcycle Crash? Know Your Rights." |
| **Truck** | "Hit by a Semi? Cases Under Review." |
| **Rideshare** | "Hurt in an Uber? Know Your Options." |
| **General MVA** | "Accident Victims May Be Entitled" |

---

## Headline Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Stat/Evidence |
|-----|-----|---------------|
| **Use Title Case** | More impactful in bold text; signals importance | Title Case headlines appear more professional in ad context |
| **Don't repeat primary text verbatim** | Each element should add new value | Repetition wastes precious character space |
| **Test emotional vs. logical** | Different audiences respond to different triggers | A/B testing reveals audience preference |
| **Numbers can work** | "3 Things..." creates curiosity and sets expectations | Numbered headlines often outperform non-numbered |
| **Curiosity-driven headlines** | "How..." "Why..." "What..." | Curiosity headlines often outperform declarative statements |
| **Avoid truncation** | Stay under 27 chars for feed safety | Truncated headlines lose impact |

### Headline Testing Framework

Test these angles against each other:

1. **Benefit** — "Compensation May Be Available"
2. **Curiosity** — "What Insurance Won't Tell You"
3. **Authority** — "Experienced Attorneys Standing By"
4. **Urgency** — "Time Limits May Apply"
5. **Social Proof** — "Thousands of Cases Reviewed" (when data available)

---

# Section 3: DESCRIPTION / LINK DESCRIPTION (Insight Hub)

The description is optional supporting text that appears below the headline in some placements.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Visible limit** | ~27 characters | Varies significantly by placement |
| **Mobile reality** | Often hidden entirely | Don't rely on it |
| **Rule** | Never put critical info here | Treat as bonus, not core |

> **Stat:** Description visibility varies dramatically by placement; some mobile placements hide it entirely. Never put critical conversion info in the description.

---

## Purpose and Function

The description serves to:

1. **Reinforce headline** with secondary value
2. **Add social proof, soft urgency, or risk reversal**
3. **Complement, don't repeat** — Each element adds something new

---

## Best Uses for Description

| Use Case | Example | Char Count | Why It Works |
|----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Risk Reversal** | "No upfront cost" | 14 | Removes friction/fear |
| **Social Proof** | "Trusted by thousands" | 19 | Builds credibility |
| **Soft Urgency** | "Time limits apply" | 17 | Compliant urgency |
| **Clarification** | "Free case evaluation" | 20 | Clear value exchange |
| **Process** | "Speak with an attorney" | 21 | Sets expectation |
| **Qualifier** | "Cases being accepted" | 20 | Signals availability |

### Description Examples by Context

| Context | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lead Gen** | "Free case evaluation" |
| **Quiz Funnel** | "See if you qualify" |
| **Retargeting** | "No upfront cost" |
| **Cold Traffic** | "Legal options available" |

---

## Description Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Stat/Evidence |
|-----|-----|---------------|
| **Write copy that works WITHOUT description** | It often won't show | Mobile hides description in many placements |
| **Keep under 25 characters** | Ensures no truncation anywhere | Even 27 chars can get cut in some placements |
| **Use Sentence case** | Less prominent placement; sentence case is more natural | Description is supporting text, not headline |
| **Don't repeat headline** | Wastes the opportunity to add value | Each element should contribute something new |
| **Treat as bonus** | Don't rely on it for conversion | Core message must work without it |

---

# Section 4: CTA / CALL TO ACTION (Insight Hub)

The CTA includes both the Meta button selection and any in-copy call to action.

---

## Specifications

| Element | Options | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Button** | Meta presets only | Learn More, Sign Up, Shop Now, Contact Us, etc. |
| **In-copy CTA** | Your language | Within primary text or headline |
| **Alignment** | Must match | Button and in-copy CTA should align in intent |

---

## Button Selection by Objective

| Campaign Goal | Recommended Button | Why |
|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Lead Generation** | "Learn More" | Low commitment, curiosity-driven |
| **Form Submissions** | "Sign Up" | Clear expectation setting |
| **Awareness** | "Learn More" | Educational framing |
| **Quiz Funnel** | "Learn More" | Soft entry point |
| **Retargeting** | "Sign Up" or "Get Quote" | Higher intent audience |

> **Insight:** For Second Chair's cold traffic lead gen, "Learn More" is recommended. It's low commitment and doesn't scare off users who aren't ready to talk to an attorney.

---

## In-Copy CTA Language

### High Performers for Second Chair

| CTA | Why It Works | Context |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| "See If You Qualify" | Curiosity + low commitment + qualifying language | Quiz funnels, cold traffic |
| "Get a Free Case Evaluation" | Clear value exchange; "free" removes friction | Landing pages, form fills |
| "Learn About Your Options" | Educational, non-pushy; compliant | Awareness campaigns |
| "Find Out What You're Owed" | Implies money waiting (use carefully) | Retargeting |
| "Connect With an Attorney" | Clear next step | Warm/hot traffic |

> **Stat:** "Show me how it works" outperformed generic CTAs by 2x CTR in Reddit testing. Specificity and curiosity beat generic language.

### CTAs to Avoid

| ❌ Avoid | Why |
|---------|-----|
| "Click Here" | Vague, no value proposition |
| "Submit" | Feels transactional, cold |
| "Call Now!" | High commitment for cold traffic |
| "Don't Wait!" | Banned urgency language |
| "Get $100,000" | Guarantee language, banned |

---

## CTA Alignment Principle

The in-copy CTA should match the button text in intent. Mixed signals kill conversion.

| ❌ Misaligned | ✅ Aligned |
|--------------|-----------|
| Button: "Learn More" / Copy: "Call Now!" | Button: "Learn More" / Copy: "See what options are available" |
| Button: "Sign Up" / Copy: "Just browse around" | Button: "Sign Up" / Copy: "Get your free case evaluation" |

---

## CTA Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Stat/Evidence |
|-----|-----|---------------|
| **One CTA per ad** | Multiple CTAs confuse and reduce conversion | Single CTA focus consistently outperforms multi-CTA ads (Reddit PPC consensus) |
| **Action verbs in imperative form** | Creates momentum | "Get," "See," "Learn," "Find" drive action |
| **Specificity wins** | "Get Your Free Case Review" > "Click Here" | Specific CTAs outperform generic 2x+ |
| **Soft CTAs for cold traffic** | High-commitment CTAs scare off cold users | Match CTA commitment level to audience temperature |
| **Align button and copy** | Mixed signals = confused users = no click | Consistency builds confidence |

### CTA Placement

| Placement | Best Practice |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Primary text** | End of copy, after education/benefit |
| **Video** | Verbal + text overlay in final 5 seconds |
| **Quiz funnel** | After "analyzing eligibility" loading screen (builds anticipation) |
| **Landing page** | Sticky button at bottom of mobile screen (always visible) |

# Section 5: UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES (Cross-Cutting Insights)

Techniques and principles that apply across all copy fields.

---

## Emoji Usage

### Research Findings

| Finding | Stat/Evidence |
|---------|---------------|
| **CTR lift when used strategically** | 10-20% CTR improvement in some tests |
| **Can hurt in high-involvement decisions** | Some studies show emojis decrease purchase intent in serious/professional contexts |
| **Overuse = spam signal** | Excessive emojis correlate with lower trust |

### Emoji Guidelines for Second Chair

| Guideline | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Test with/without** | Legal services = professional context; emojis may hurt credibility |
| **Max 1-2 if used** | Sparingly or not at all |
| **Placement** | End of headline or to highlight key benefit |
| **Purpose** | Must reinforce message, not decorate |

### What to Avoid with Emojis

- Replacing words with emojis (clarity loss)
- Multiple emojis in one line (spam signal)
- Emojis that don't match tone (misalignment)
- Emojis in serious/sensitive contexts (inappropriate)

> **Second Chair recommendation:** Default to no emojis. Test sparingly. If using, limit to 1 well-placed emoji that reinforces the message (e.g., ✅ for "approved" or "qualified").

---

## Case and Capitalization

### Case by Copy Element

| Element | Recommended Case | Why |
|---------|------------------|-----|
| **Headlines** | Title Case | More impactful in bold; signals importance |
| **Primary text** | Sentence case | Conversational, human, natural |
| **Description** | Sentence case | Supporting text, less prominent |

### ALL CAPS Guidelines

| ✅ Acceptable | ❌ Avoid |
|--------------|---------|
| Single emphasis words: "FREE," "NOW" | Full sentences in ALL CAPS |
| Sparingly, for key terms | Multiple ALL CAPS words |

> **Stat:** All caps + excessive emojis = low trust signals. (Reddit r/FacebookAds consensus)

---

## Punctuation and Formatting

### Punctuation Guidelines

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Exclamation points** | Max 1 per ad, if any |
| **Question marks** | Use for hook questions |
| **Ellipses** | Sparingly for curiosity gaps |
| **Periods** | Normal sentence endings |

### What to Avoid

| ❌ Avoid | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Excessive punctuation (!!!, ???) | Spam signal |
| Unicode bold/italic | Can trigger ad rejection |
| Decorative symbols | Unprofessional |
| Line of emojis | Spam signal |

> **Stat:** Clean formatting correlates with higher perceived credibility. (User trust studies)

### Line Break Best Practices

- Use liberally for mobile readability
- One idea per line/section
- Create visual breathing room
- Break before CTA for emphasis

---

## Testing Framework

### What to Test

| Variable | Variants |
|----------|----------|
| **Primary text length** | Short (~80 chars), Medium (~125 chars), Long (~200+ chars) |
| **Emoji** | With emoji vs. without |
| **Emotional angle** | Empathy, Accountability, Protection, Urgency |
| **Hook type** | Loss aversion, Insider, Myth buster, Question |
| **Headline** | Benefit vs. Curiosity vs. Authority |
| **CTA** | Soft vs. Direct |

### Testing Cadence

| Metric | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Frequency 2.5+** | Refresh creative |
| **7-14 days** | Rotate creative regardless |
| **CTR dropping** | Test new hooks |
| **High CTR, low conversion** | Test CTA/landing page alignment |

> **Stat:** Ad fatigue sets in around frequency 2.5+. Refresh when performance dips.

---

## The "One Message" Rule

Each ad should contain:

- **One audience** — Who is this for?
- **One problem** — What pain point?
- **One solution** — What do we offer?
- **One CTA** — What action?

> **Stat:** Focused single-message ads consistently outperform multi-message ads. (Reddit PPC, agency testing)

### Bad Example (Multi-Message)

> "Car accident? Truck accident? Motorcycle crash? Slip and fall? We handle it all! Call now or visit our website or fill out the form..."

### Good Example (Single Message)

> "Car accident victims often don't realize what they're entitled to. Insurance companies have teams of lawyers. Shouldn't you? See if you qualify."

---

## Mobile-First Reality

### The Mobile Imperative

| Stat | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **90%+ of Meta users are on mobile** | Design for mobile first, always |
| **1.7 seconds average scroll time** | Hook must work instantly |
| **125 chars before truncation** | Front-load everything important |
| **Description often hidden** | Don't rely on description |

### Mobile Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Hook in first 125 characters
- [ ] Short sentences, line breaks
- [ ] Works without description showing
- [ ] Headline under 27 characters
- [ ] Preview on actual phone screen

> **Stat:** Mobile truncation is the #1 reason good copy fails. Always preview mobile.

---

## Psychological Triggers (Ranked for PI)

Based on behavioral science research and PI marketing effectiveness:

| Rank | Trigger | Copy Approach | Example |
|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | **Loss Aversion** | Frame as losing rights/money vs. gaining | "Don't lose your right to..." |
| 2 | **Regret Aversion** | Invoke future self looking back | "5 years from now, will you wish..." |
| 3 | **Authority Contrast** | David vs. Goliath framing | "They have teams of lawyers. You have us." |
| 4 | **Information Asymmetry** | Insider knowledge positioning | "What adjusters are trained not to tell you..." |
| 5 | **Temporal Scarcity** | Deadline urgency (real, not fake) | "Evidence disappears faster than you think..." |
| 6 | **Moral Outrage** | Fairness violation framing | "They profit when you accept less." |

---

## What Works in Snapchat Headlines

### Headline Formula

**Structure:** [Action/Hook] + [Benefit/Context]

| Headline | Characters | Elements |
|----------|------------|----------|
| "In a crash? Free case review" | 28 | Question + Offer |
| "Don't sign that check" | 21 | Warning + Action |
| "Know your rights now" | 20 | Benefit + Urgency |
| "Hurt in a wreck? Swipe up" | 25 | Question + CTA |
| "Free legal help—no fees" | 24 | Offer + Qualifier |
| "Accident? Get answers fast" | 27 | Question + Benefit |

---

## Headline Types for Younger Audiences

Snapchat's audience responds to different triggers than older demographics:

| Type | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Direct Question** | "Were you in a crash?" | Immediate relevance check |
| **Warning** | "Don't take the first offer" | Loss aversion |
| **Action Command** | "Swipe for free help" | Clear, immediate action |
| **Value Statement** | "Free case review" | Obvious benefit |
| **Curiosity** | "What Uber won't tell you" | Information gap |

---

## Headline Specific Tips

| Tip | Why | Evidence |
|-----|-----|----------|
| **Use active verbs** | Motion and action appeal to young audience | Passive language feels stale |
| **Match the visual** | Headline + visual = one message | Mismatched messages confuse |
| **Front-load key words** | Eyes hit top first | Critical info first |
| **Test short vs. ultra-short** | Sometimes 15 chars beats 34 | Less can be more |
| **Include the offer** | "Free" works | Value-driven messaging converts |

---

# Section 2: BRAND NAME / DISPLAY NAME (Insight Hub)

The brand name appears alongside the ad, providing context.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Character limit** | 25 characters | Branding opportunity |
| **Purpose** | Identity + Value hint | Can be action-oriented |

---

## Display Name Strategy

The display name doesn't have to be just "Second Chair." It can be a mini-CTA or value hint.

### Display Name Options

| Display Name | Characters | Purpose |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| "Second Chair" | 11 | Standard branding |
| "Free Case Review" | 16 | Value proposition |
| "Claim Your Estimate" | 19 | Action-oriented |
| "Legal Help 24/7" | 15 | Availability |
| "Get Compensated" | 15 | Benefit-focused |

> **Recommendation for Second Chair:** Test "Free Case Review" as display name vs. brand name. Value proposition may outperform branding with cold audiences.

---

# Section 3: CTA BUTTON (Insight Hub)

The CTA button drives the swipe-up action.

---

## Specifications

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Options** | Standard Snapchat set | Swipe Up action |
| **Available CTAs** | Learn More, Sign Up, Get Now, Apply Now, View |

---

## CTA Selection for Second Chair

| Campaign Goal | Recommended CTA | Why |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| **Lead Generation** | "Learn More" | Low commitment |
| **Quiz Funnel** | "Get Now" | Implies immediate value |
| **Direct Action** | "Apply Now" | When audience is warm |

> **Snapchat Note:** "Swipe Up" is the native action. Copy should reinforce this: "Swipe to get help" or "Swipe for free review."

---

## CTA Specific Tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| **Reinforce in headline** | "Swipe for free case review" aligns CTA |
| **Use in text overlay** | Visual CTA on final frame |
| **Keep it low commitment** | Young audiences resist hard sells |
| **Match landing page** | Swipe should deliver what was promised |

---

# Section 4: TEXT OVERLAYS (Insight Hub)

Text overlays on the video/image creative are critical for Snapchat.

---

## Text Overlay Best Practices

### Snapchat is Visual-First

> **Key Insight:** On Snapchat, the video/image carries the message. Text supports, doesn't replace.

### Overlay Guidelines

| Aspect | Best Practice | Why |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| **Font** | Native Snapchat fonts | Matches organic content |
| **Size** | Large, readable on mobile | 100% mobile platform |
| **Placement** | Avoid edges and corners | UI elements cover these |
| **Animation** | Use motion | Static text gets scrolled past |

### What to Put in Overlays

| Overlay Purpose | Example | Timing |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| **Hook Reinforcement** | "DON'T accept that offer" | First 1-2 seconds |
| **Key Point** | "Insurance companies lowball" | When making point |
| **CTA** | "SWIPE UP" | Final 2-3 seconds |
| **Offer** | "FREE Case Review" | Throughout or end |

---

## Overlay Specific Tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| **One message per overlay** | Clarity over density |
| **Match audio timing** | Text appears as spoken |
| **Use contrast** | Ensure readability on any background |
| **Keep moving** | Animated text performs better |

---

# Section 5: VIDEO CREATIVE STRATEGY (Insight Hub)

Since Snapchat is video-heavy, copy strategy integrates with video.

---

## Optimal Video Length

| Duration | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **3-5 seconds** | Quick hook, simple message |
| **6-10 seconds** | Complete message with CTA |
| **10+ seconds** | Educational or story content |

> **Recommendation:** 3-10 seconds for Second Chair. Fast, punchy content wins.

---

## Video Script Structure (6-10 Seconds)

```
0:00-0:02 (HOOK):
[Bold statement or question on screen + audio]

0:02-0:06 (VALUE):
[Quick explanation of benefit]

0:06-0:08 (CTA):
[Clear call to action with SWIPE UP]
```

### Example Script (Second Chair Compliant)

```
0:00-0:02:
"Accident? Know this before signing anything."
[Text overlay: "IMPORTANT"]

0:02-0:06:
"That first check is almost never what your case is worth."
[Text overlay: "Insurance lowballs"]

0:06-0:08:
"Free case review—swipe up."
[Text overlay: "SWIPE UP"]
```

---

## Video Hooks That Work on Snapchat

Same hook principles as TikTok, adapted for even faster pace:

| Hook Type | Example | Characters |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Warning** | "Stop! Read this first" | Quick and direct |
| **Question** | "Uber accident?" | Qualifies immediately |
| **Curiosity** | "They don't want you to know..." | Information gap |
| **Bold Claim** | "You're owed more than you think" | Provocative (keep compliant) |

---

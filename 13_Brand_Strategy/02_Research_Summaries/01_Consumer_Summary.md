## The Three Things to Know

1. **We have two customers, not one.** The PI attorney (B2B) is who we sell to. The accident victim (B2C) is who we advertise to. The brand's core insight is that both of them are being failed by the current system — and that serving one honestly is the same act as serving the other.

2. **PI attorneys don't want leads. They want certainty.** The pipeline isn't a business metric. It's the emotional pulse of the practice. When it stops, the anxiety is immediate; the financial crisis takes another 9–24 months to arrive. We're in the certainty business, not the lead business.

3. **Accident victims don't want to sue. They want to be seen.** The average accident victim leaves $33,700 on the table by not calling an attorney. But the deeper loss isn't the money — it's being moved through a system that has every incentive not to treat them fairly, with no one genuinely in their corner.

## The B2B Consumer: The PI Attorney

### Who They Are

The PI attorney is a small business owner who entered a difficult profession for real reasons — fighting for people who can't fight for themselves — and who now spends substantial emotional energy managing the pipeline that makes that work possible. The market is 50,435 firms, 75–85% solos or 2–5 attorney shops. **Second Chair's target is the growth-stage firm: 2–20 attorneys, $200K–$20M revenue.**

### The Four Buyer Profiles

| Profile | Core Need | What Moves Them |
|---|---|---|
| **Hungry Solo** | Pipeline now | Gut, speed, "will this work?" |
| **Established Builder** (primary target) | Sustainable growth | ROI data + competitive intelligence |
| **Marketing Director** | System + reporting | Data-first, accountable metrics |
| **Tired King** | Respect + ease | Peer validation, not another sales pitch |

### What They Actually Fear

The ambulance-chaser stigma is mostly self-generated, not externally validated — attorneys think the public views them far more negatively than the public actually does. The real wound: **lead gen stripped away the good feeling about how they got the client.** With a referral, someone they respected said they were good. Lead gen replaced that with an anonymous pipeline they don't trust and advertising they can't see.

### How They Buy (The Say-Do Gap)

Attorneys say they buy on quality. Behaviorally, they anchor on per-lead cost because quality can't be verified before purchase. The actual evaluation metric — the one that determines whether they renew — is **cost-per-signed-case (CPSC)**. The vendor who speaks CPSC instead of CPL is speaking the attorney's real language.

**Critical data point:** 79% of legal consumers hire the first attorney who responds. Response within 1 minute converts at 391% higher rates than the industry median of 13 minutes. Speed to contact is the #1 conversion lever — which is also why the race-to-the-phone shared lead model is destroying the attorney-client relationship before it starts.

### When They're Most Open

- **January–March:** Seasonal volume drops. Attorneys can't tell if the slowdown is seasonal or existential. This is the highest-ROI sales window in the year.
- **PILMMA Super Summit (May):** Entrepreneurial identity is highest; most open to marketing conversations.
- **Post-disruption moments:** New competitor billboard, tort reform news, a Morgan & Morgan surge in their market.

## The B2C Consumer: The Accident Victim

### Who They Are

The accident victim is an ordinary person — working-class to middle-class, mean age ~40, 74% employed, 61% low-to-middle income — who was living an ordinary life until something changed without warning. Four personas: Maria Delgado (working parent in crisis), DeShawn Williams (small business owner who can't be down), Jennifer Torres (young digital native, unaware of her rights), Robert Holtz (retired, low energy for legal process).

### The $33,700 Gap

In California, accident victims who consulted an attorney before accepting a settlement averaged **$47,300**. Those who didn't averaged **$13,600.** Same injuries, same accidents. The gap is the cost of not knowing you have options.

- 68% of accident victims accept the first offer without consulting an attorney
- 91% of quick-settlers later found their compensation was insufficient
- More than 90% of injury victims "lump it" — absorb losses without ever claiming

### The Three Behavioral Barriers

1. **The minimization instinct:** "I don't want to be the kind of person who sues." Identity conflict with the plaintiff role is the primary barrier to action — not information, not money, not access.
2. **Optimism bias about insurers:** "They'll be fair. I was in the right." First-offer acceptance happens at peak financial stress, before the adjuster's strategy becomes visible.
3. **Present bias:** The adjuster calls first — often within hours. Their frame is established before the claimant has any competing information.

### The 72-Hour Window

This is when everything is decided. The adjuster's deliberate early contact is designed to get a recorded statement and establish expectations before legal counsel is involved. Second Chair's B2C advertising must reach the accident victim **before or concurrent with the adjuster's first call**.

The minimum viable action that overcomes all three barriers: **"One call. 10 minutes. Free. No commitment. Before you say yes to anything."**

## The Connection Between the Two

**The attorney who wants to fight for people and the accident victim who needs someone fighting for them are connected by Second Chair — and they keep failing to find each other honestly.**

The current lead gen category breaks the connection. It sends attorneys clients who were told they'd get millions. It sends accident victims to attorneys who race to the phone. It makes the attorney who cares about ethics indistinguishable from the one who doesn't.

Second Chair's honest B2C advertising serves both consumers with the same act:
- The accident victim gets accurate information before a decision they can't take back
- The attorney gets a client whose expectations match reality — and advertising they don't have to apologize for

## Key Decisions from the Research

**B2C budget split:** 60% pre-accident brand advertising (general awareness, all demographics) / 40% timing-targeted performance (72-hour window, specific behavioral moments)

**B2B campaign direction:** "Cases that don't start with a lie" / "See the advertising we run before you commit to anything"

**B2C campaign direction:** "I almost didn't call. I'm glad I did." — testimonial series, real people, documentary aesthetic, no scales of justice, no settlement fantasies

**Forbidden in B2C creative:** "sue," "claim," "fight," "deserve," "millions," actor testimonials, dramatic music, AI calculators with fabricated data

**The brand identity statement:** *Second Chair is certainty for the attorney and honesty for the claimant, delivered by the same act: advertising that doesn't lie.*

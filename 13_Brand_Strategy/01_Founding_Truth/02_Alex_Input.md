## What This Is and Why It Matters Right Now

**Second Chair** is a PI (personal injury) lead generation company that Davis and Alex are building together. The premise: PI attorneys need cases. The existing lead gen category is broken — shared leads, misleading consumer advertising, opaque pricing, and a vendor revenue model that is completely misaligned with attorney outcomes. Second Chair's model is different: honest consumer advertising, cost-per-signed-case measurement (not cost-per-lead), and a product infrastructure that makes transparency possible and durable.

**The research that already exists:** The agency team that Davis works with has spent months studying this market — 52+ research documents covering the PI attorney consumer (what they actually want, what keeps them up at night, where they've been burned), the category (every major vendor, their failure modes, the white space), and the culture (what this moment in the PI legal market makes possible). The summary of what that research found:

- The deepest thing PI attorneys want is not more leads. They want to stop worrying about their pipeline. The vendor that gives them genuine certainty — not just more leads — wins the category.
- The category's consumer advertising is widely recognized, even among PI attorneys, as misleading and exploitative. It creates clients with unrealistic expectations, which makes the attorney's job harder. No vendor is running advertising an attorney could show to their own clients.
- There is a structural opening: the vendor that publishes its cost-per-signed-case data, runs honest consumer advertising, and builds a product that makes this transparent and verifiable cannot be copied by existing vendors — because existing vendors can't change their revenue model without dismantling their businesses.

**Why your input is needed now:** The brand strategy process is about to begin. Davis will drive the creative and strategic direction. But the strategy can only be as strong as both founders' inputs. Alex's product thinking — specifically, what he sees when he reads the research problems, and what he knows he can build — is a core part of what makes Second Chair different from everything else in the category. A strategy built without that input will need to be partially rewritten once Alex is in the room. This document captures it upfront.

**What to do:** Answer each question below as specifically and honestly as you can. Don't try to make it sound polished. Raw notes, bullet points, or voice memo transcripts are fine — Davis will synthesize from there. The one rule: no marketing language. Answer as if someone is asking you to explain, in a deposition, what you can actually build and why it matters.

## Question 1: What You See in the Research Problems

The research identified five specific tension points in the PI lead gen category. Read each one and react — not with what Second Chair should say about it, but with what product it makes you want to build.

**Tension 1 — Certainty vs. Unpredictable Delivery**
Attorneys don't want leads. They want the Monday morning where they don't have to check the dashboard twelve times. The category's pipeline is unpredictable because vendor incentives (subscription fees, lead volume) don't align with attorney outcomes (cases signed). The attorney carries the uncertainty alone.

*What product does this make you want to build? What does "giving an attorney genuine certainty about their pipeline" look like as a technical system — not as a brand promise, but as something you'd actually architect?*

**Tension 2 — Trust vs. Category-Wide Credibility Crisis**
The leading vendors in this category have 1.3/5 and 2.1/5 star ratings from attorneys who've used them. The trust deficit is systemic. Attorneys make vendor decisions essentially blind — 65% of vendors don't publish pricing, and no vendor publishes cost-per-signed-case data with methodology.

*What product resolves this? What does "a vendor the attorney can actually verify" look like as something you'd build — a dashboard, a data layer, an audit trail? What would it take to give an attorney real-time visibility into the information they need to evaluate Second Chair's performance?*

**Tension 3 — The 72-Hour Window**
The most important structural fact in PI lead gen: the insurance adjuster calls the accident victim before the attorney does. In the 72 hours post-accident, the adjuster frames the negotiation. Victims who spoke to an attorney before accepting a settlement averaged $47,300 vs. $13,600 for those who didn't. No lead gen vendor has built the infrastructure to consistently reach accident victims in this window with advertising honest enough to actually convert.

*What would you build to own this moment? What does the 72-hour infrastructure look like — the targeting logic, the intake system, the speed-to-contact mechanism? What's the architectural difference between what Second Chair could build here and what a typical lead gen vendor could build with the same brief?*

**Tension 4 — Professional Identity vs. Industry Association**
PI attorneys entered the profession to fight for people who can't fight for themselves. The advertising the lead gen category runs in their name — actors pretending to be real clients, implied government compensation programs, settlement fantasy promises — is something many attorneys are privately ashamed of. They can't control what their vendors are running.

*What product gives the attorney control over what advertising is running in their name? What does "the attorney who can verify the advertising before it runs" look like as a technical system?*

**Tension 5 — Information vs. Exploitation**
The category's B2C advertising exploits the accident victim's information asymmetry. They don't know what their case is worth. They don't know what settlement they'd typically receive. The advertising gives them a fantasy, not a fact — because fantasy converts better than honesty (or so the category assumes).

*Second Chair's thesis is that honest advertising with real data (the $33,700 average settlement gap, the "one call before you answer" framing) can outperform fantasy advertising because it generates better-quality, better-informed clients. What does the product infrastructure that supports this thesis look like? How do you build a system that can consistently deliver honest advertising, measure its conversion rate accurately, and prove to an attorney that honesty outperforms the alternative?*

## Question 2: Your Technical Competitive Advantages — Made Specific

This is not a question about your résumé. It's a question about application.

**What can you build for Second Chair that a well-funded competitor with a good agency relationship and a $10M budget cannot build — or cannot build as well, or cannot build as fast?**

Think about:

- Your speed advantage. The research mentioned you build with languages and approaches that produce funnels significantly faster than industry standard. What specifically is that advantage, and what does it mean for the attorney's experience or Second Chair's cost structure?
- Your compliance-grade infrastructure experience. You built a 0-to-1 mobile trading app to FINRA/SEC compliance standards at TradeStation. PI advertising has compliance requirements (TCPA, state bar rules, FTC guidelines). What does a compliance-first product architecture look like in this context, and why does your background make it easier to build right the first time?
- Your conversion optimization expertise. CXL certification in conversion optimization and digital psychology, Reforge training in growth and product strategy. How does this apply to the intake flow — the moment between an accident victim seeing an ad and an attorney receiving a qualified contact?
- Your AI-native development approach. You built a trading platform using a team of AI agents with Claude Code. What does that capability unlock in Second Chair's product development — specifically, what can you build faster or at lower cost because of how you develop?

*(Two or three real technical advantages with depth are more useful here than a comprehensive list. Pick the ones that matter most for what Second Chair specifically needs to build.)*

## Question 3: The MVP — If You Had to Ship One Product First

Given everything you know about what Second Chair is trying to do — honest B2C advertising, CPSC measurement, transparent performance data for attorneys — and given everything you know about what you can build:

**If you had to ship one product first, what is it and why?**

Specifically:
- What does it do?
- Who uses it (attorney-facing, claimant-facing, or internal to Second Chair)?
- What problem does it solve that can't be solved without it?
- Why is this the first one — what does it unlock that everything else builds on?
- Rough scope: how long to ship something real, with what resources?

*(This question is about sequencing and judgment, not about being comprehensive. What's the one thing that has to exist before the other things matter?)*

**Your answer:**

## Question 4: Your Product Hypotheses

You have working assumptions right now about what Second Chair's product should be. Some of them are confident. Some of them are gut feelings. All of them are useful.

**What are your current working hypotheses about what Second Chair's product layer looks like?**

Address each horizon — even if your answer is "I don't have a view on this yet" or "it depends on what we learn in the first 90 days":

**At 6 months (MVP live, first attorney accounts):** What does Second Chair's product look like when the first attorneys are using it? What are they seeing? What are they able to do? What does Second Chair have that no existing vendor has?

**At 12 months (early traction, proving the model):** What has been built, tested, and proven? What does the product look like when it has data from real attorney accounts that it can use to demonstrate the CPSC model working?

**At 12–18 months (the expansion thesis):** Davis has said the model should be provable in PI MVA and then expandable to other high-CPL legal verticals within a year to a year and a half. What does the product infrastructure need to look like at the start for that expansion to be possible without a full rebuild? What do you build modularly from day one?

**The one hypothesis you're most confident about:** What do you know about the product that you'd stake the architecture on?

**The one hypothesis you're least sure about:** What's the assumption that needs the most validation before you'd commit to it as the direction?

**Your answer:**

## Question 5: Your Honest Gaps

This is the question most people skip. It's the most important one.

**What don't you know yet about what Second Chair needs to build? Where are your honest gaps — things you'd need to research, validate, or learn before you'd commit to a specific product direction?**

Specifically:
- Are there specific PI advertising compliance requirements (state bar rules, FTC guidelines, TCPA) that you'd need to research before architecting the intake and targeting system?
- Are there things about how PI attorneys actually use technology day-to-day — their CRM, their intake software, their reporting preferences — that you'd need to understand before designing the attorney-facing product?
- Are there competitors' products you'd want to audit before deciding what to build and what to integrate vs. build from scratch?
- Are there specific data questions — what data Second Chair needs to collect from day one to make the CPSC model work — that you're not certain about?

*(This question produces the validation plan. Before the strategy sessions finalize the product layer, these gaps need to be filled. Be honest about where they are.)*

**Your answer:**

## Question 6: What You See That Davis Doesn't

Davis drives the creative and strategic direction. You drive the product. But you also think creatively and strategically — just from a completely different vantage point. The research made this explicit: your product ideas will change and expand what Second Chair can claim to be, in ways Davis can't see from the advertising side.

**What do you see in this problem — in what Second Chair is trying to do — that Davis probably hasn't thought about, because it requires the builder's lens to see?**

This could be:
- A product idea that the research problems make obvious to you but that wouldn't occur to someone thinking primarily about advertising
- A technical capability or architectural decision that would give Second Chair a competitive advantage Davis hasn't named
- A business model angle — how the product generates revenue, scales, or compounds over time — that follows from what you can build
- Something you know about how attorneys use technology that changes the product direction in a way the research didn't capture

*(There are no wrong answers here. This question is designed to surface what the other questions missed — the ideas that come from your specific way of thinking about problems.)*

**Your answer:**

## Question 7: The Personal Conviction — Why This Matters Beyond the Product

Everything above was about what you can build. This is about why you're building it here, for this market, with these people. The brand needs to know what's underneath the capability — the conviction that will come through in every sales conversation, every product decision, every piece of work Second Chair puts into the world.

No marketing language. Answer the way you'd answer if someone asked you this in a private conversation.

---

**A story from your life:**
Davis mentioned that someone in your life had a PI attorney fight for them — and it changed things. What's that story? Be specific. What happened, what did the attorney do, and what was the outcome that wouldn't have existed otherwise? This is one of the most important things in this document. The strategy team needs the specific version, not the general version.

**Your answer:**

---

**The underappreciation parallel — with structural nuance:**
You built a 0-to-1 mobile trading app at TradeStation — a million users, 99.96% crash-free, 100% FINRA/SEC compliant. From scratch. Then the role ended. Not because your work wasn't exceptional — TradeStation moved in a different direction, and the value you created didn't flow back to you — because that is the structural reality of employment. The person doing the work and the person controlling the economics are separated. Your parents' scoreboard registered the layoff. It didn't register what you actually built.

You know what it's like to do something genuinely extraordinary and have the system around you not reflect that back. PI attorneys experience a version of this constantly: they do consequential, technically demanding, emotionally costly work fighting for people who had nowhere else to go, and the culture brands them ambulance chasers. Society reduces an entire profession — one that changes lives — to a punchline.

How does your experience connect to that? What do you understand about being inside a system that doesn't recognize what you've actually done — that someone who went straight from school to a high-paying title at a company that didn't lay them off wouldn't understand?

**Your answer:**

---

**Why here, why this:**
You could be building fintech products. You could be doing any number of things with your background. Why are you specifically here — building the product infrastructure for honest PI lead generation? Not the business case. Not "it's a good opportunity." The personal answer. What is it about this market, this problem, or these people that makes this the thing you want to spend the next several years building?

**Your answer:**

---

**Your relationship to justice — as a life value:**
Not brand language. What is your actual relationship to the idea that systems should treat people fairly? Where does it come from? What does it look like in your life — the decisions you've made, the things you've walked away from, the things you've fought for? When you think about an accident victim in the 72 hours after a crash, before the insurance adjuster's call has established what their options are — what do you feel about what the system is doing to that person? And what does it mean to you that Second Chair changes that for even one person?

**Your answer:**

---

**The cycle Second Chair breaks:**
TradeStation's constraints produced your layoff. The PI lead gen category's misaligned incentives produce a situation where attorneys pay for leads that don't deliver and claimants receive advertising that exploits rather than informs. These are the same structural pattern: value created in one place flows to whoever controls the economics, not back to the person who created it or who deserved fair treatment.

Second Chair is designed to break this pattern at the level it controls — founders own equity, vendor success is tied to signed cases, the advertising serves the claimant. You're not just building a product. You're building a business model that refuses to replicate the structure that produced your own worst professional experience.

Does that feel true to you? Is that part of why this company matters — not just as a market opportunity but as a statement about what a business should be?

**Your answer:**

## After You've Filled This Out

Send your completed answers back to Davis. Format doesn't matter — bullet points, paragraphs, voice memo transcript, however you think fastest. Davis will handle the synthesis.

Once Davis has both his input and yours, you'll do one session together to answer the joint questions (the fusion, the shared non-negotiables, the honest limitations). That session should take about 60–90 minutes.

After the joint session, the brand strategy process begins. Your direct involvement picks up again after the creative brief is locked — at which point you'll review the full strategy and respond from the product side: what you'd build to fulfill it, how, and what new product ideas it opens up that the strategy team couldn't have seen without your lens.

Questions: talk to Davis.

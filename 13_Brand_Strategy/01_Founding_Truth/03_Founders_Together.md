# Founding Truth Input — Davis + Alex Together
## Complete After 01_Davis_Input.md and 02_Alex_Input.md Are Both Done

**This document cannot be filled out until both founders have completed their individual input documents.** The questions here require both founders in the same conversation — because they can only be answered by integrating each founder's individual thinking, not by either founder alone.

**Format:** A call, a shared voice session, or a written back-and-forth. Rough is fine. One person can drive the writing while the other responds. The goal is honest, specific alignment between both founders — not a polished document. Plan for 60–90 minutes.

**The one rule that applies to everything here:** No marketing language. No "we believe in transparency" without saying what that means specifically and operationally. If an answer starts to sound like a pitch deck, challenge it. The version that's real is always more specific than the version that sounds good.

## Question 1: The Fusion — What Only This Team Can Do Together

This is the most important question in the entire pre-brief process. Not what Davis does. Not what Alex does. What happens when both are operating as a single founding team, for the same outcome, in the same company.

**What can Second Chair execute — end to end — that would require two separate companies to attempt for anyone else in the PI lead gen category?**

The framing to work from: most competitors either have advertising capability (agencies they hire, media they buy) or product capability (tech infrastructure they've built). Almost none have both operating from the same founding intent. Second Chair does. The question is: what does that actually produce that cannot be produced otherwise?

Be specific about the mechanism — not just "better results" or "an integrated solution," but what specifically happens at the point where Davis's advertising decision meets Alex's product decision, and why that intersection produces something that two separate companies negotiating with each other cannot.

Some angles to push through together:
- When Davis designs an honest ad for the 72-hour window, what does Alex's intake infrastructure do with it that a hired tech vendor working from a brief couldn't? Where does the integration between the advertising intent and the product behavior produce something that only works if the same founders control both?
- When Alex builds the attorney analytics dashboard to show CPSC data in real time, what does Davis's advertising strategy do with that transparency that a typical creative agency given the same dashboard couldn't? Where does the strategy follow the data in a way that requires the same founder who designed the advertising to be reading the dashboard?
- What decisions does Second Chair make in a week that a competitor would spend six months negotiating between their agency and their tech vendor — and why does the speed of that decision matter for what they can deliver?

## Question 2: Shared Non-Negotiables as a Company

Each founder has individual non-negotiables. This question is about the ones that belong to the company — the commitments that both founders have made to each other and to the market, that cannot be negotiated away regardless of competitive pressure, investor pressure, or a revenue opportunity that looks compelling in the short term.

**What will Second Chair never do, regardless of the argument for doing it?**

Work through these together. For each one, both founders should agree that it's a permanent commitment — not a current preference or a first-year rule that gets reconsidered when the business needs cash.

Some areas to work through:
- **Lead sharing:** Will Second Chair ever sell the same lead to two attorneys simultaneously? Under what circumstances, if any?
- **Consumer advertising standards:** Are there specific advertising tactics — implied government programs, settlement calculators with no real data behind them, actor testimonials presented as real clients — that are categorically off the table even if a specific execution could be argued as technically compliant?
- **Pricing transparency:** Is publishing CPSC data a permanent commitment or a current intention? What would it take for both founders to agree to stop publishing it?
- **Exclusivity:** Will Second Chair ever compromise on lead exclusivity — one contact, one attorney — for a pricing or volume reason?
- **Attorney types:** Are there attorney profiles or firm types that Second Chair will not serve — firms that couldn't fulfill the honest advertising promise even with Second Chair's product, or firms whose practices conflict with the justice orientation?

Add any non-negotiable that isn't covered above. These become the ethical architecture that the strategy sessions build around.

## Question 3: Honest Limitations — What Second Chair Cannot Do Yet

This is the honesty question. The strategy process will produce a vision. That vision needs to be grounded in what the founding team can actually deliver — not as a constraint on ambition, but because overpromising is a specific and documented failure mode for vendors in this category. The attorneys Second Chair wants to attract have been burned by overpromising vendors. Second Chair's credibility begins with being the vendor that tells the truth about what it can and cannot do.

**Where are the honest limitations right now? What can Second Chair not yet do — and in some cases, what might it never do?**

Work through each area:

**Product:** What does Second Chair not have yet at launch? What attorney expectations — for features, integrations, data, reporting — will it not be able to meet on day one? What is the honest answer when an attorney asks "can your product do X?" for things that aren't built yet?

**Geography:** Is Second Chair launching in all 50 states? If not, which markets are actually ready — meaning Second Chair has the data, the media relationships, and the regulatory clarity to serve them well? Which markets are on the roadmap but not day-one?

**Attorney profile:** Who is not the right fit right now? The research identified the growth-stage PI attorney (2–20 attorneys, $200K–$20M revenue) as the primary target. What attorney types are specifically not a good fit — too large, too small, wrong case mix, wrong geography, wrong expectations?

**Case types:** Is Second Chair launching with MVA (motor vehicle accident) cases only? If yes, what's the honest answer when an attorney asks about slip and fall, mass tort, workers' comp? Is the answer "not yet" with a real timeline, or "not in our model"?

**Speed-to-results:** How long before an attorney partner sees a case from a Second Chair lead? What's the honest expectation — not the optimistic scenario, but the baseline? At what point can Second Chair promise consistent CPSC data rather than early-stage estimates?

**Your answer (both founders responding):**

## Question 4: The Expansion Thesis — MVA First, Then What?

Davis has been explicit that Second Chair's model should prove itself in PI MVA and then expand to other high-CPL legal verticals. The research identified a pattern: verticals where attorneys currently absorb the full cost of lead generation upfront (paying CPL regardless of case outcome) and where the advertising quality is similarly poor are logical expansion targets.

**What is the honest expansion thesis? MVA first — then what, in what sequence, and on what basis?**

Work through:

**Why MVA first:** What specifically about MVA makes it the right first market — not the most obvious answer, but the founders' real reasoning? What does the MVA market teach Second Chair that a different starting vertical wouldn't?

**What the expansion requires:** What has to be true about Second Chair's MVA performance before it makes sense to expand? Is it a CPSC threshold? A number of attorney accounts? A proof that the product infrastructure is durable and modular? What does "proven" mean specifically?

**The most logical second vertical:** Given what Second Chair is building — honest advertising infrastructure, CPSC measurement, transparent product — which legal vertical is the most natural next market? Why? What changes between MVA and that vertical, and what stays the same?

**What Alex builds modularly from day one:** For the expansion to happen without a full rebuild, certain architectural decisions need to be made at the start. What are they? What does Alex build in a way that is vertical-agnostic so that the second vertical doesn't require starting over?

**The non-PI expansion question:** Is there a version of Second Chair's model that applies outside legal — other high-CPL verticals where honest advertising and CPSC measurement would solve the same category problem? Is that in scope, or is Second Chair a legal-specific company?

**Your answer (both founders responding):**

## Question 5: The Shared Justice Orientation

**Before answering this together, each founder should have already completed their individual document.** This question asks you to integrate what you each wrote there — compare your individual answers on justice and conviction, find where they converge and where they diverge, and produce the shared version. Don't answer from scratch.

The research found that Second Chair's honest advertising purpose is structurally genuine — not a marketing decision but a consequence of a business model that aligns vendor revenue with attorney outcomes. That's the systemic version. This question is about the human version underneath it.

**What do all three of you believe Second Chair owes the people inside the PI advertising supply chain — the accident victims who see its ads and the attorneys who trust it with their practices?**

Work through:

**The obligation to the claimant:** When Second Chair runs an ad that reaches an accident victim in their worst 72 hours, what does that ad owe them? What is the honest answer to "what is Second Chair doing for this person" — not what the brand says, but what all three founders actually believe the obligation is? Compare what each of you wrote in your individual documents. Where is there full alignment? Where does the phrasing differ in a way that matters?

**The obligation to the attorney:** When an attorney trusts Second Chair with a portion of their practice's growth, what does Second Chair owe them? Where does the obligation end? What's the version all three founders would commit to in writing?

**Where the justice orientation comes from — personally, for each of you:** Each founder should give a one-sentence version of why they specifically care about whether the PI advertising supply chain is honest. Then: what is the shared version — the one sentence that is true for all three?

**What it looks like when Second Chair is failing this obligation:** Name one specific scenario in which Second Chair would be violating its justice orientation — a real edge case where business pressure could make the wrong decision look reasonable. What is that scenario and what does the right decision look like?

**Your answer (all three founders responding):**

## Question 6: The Parallel, the Vocation, and the Unified Founder Story

This is the conviction question. It integrates everything from the individual documents into the shared emotional foundation of the company. All three founders should have completed their individual documents before attempting this.

---

**The structural parallel — named explicitly:**
All three founders have done work of documentable impact that the system they worked inside did not reward back to them. Davis built the Vacation brand and didn't get equity. Alex built a million-user trading platform and the role ended when TradeStation moved in a different direction. Sasha has spent years creating value for companies in contexts where his contribution was real but not fully credited. The important nuance: the people who ran those organizations weren't villains. They were inside their own financial and structural constraints. That's the pattern — value created in one place flows to the people who control the economics, not automatically back to the person who created it.

This same pattern runs through the PI lead gen category. Attorneys pay for leads that don't deliver. Claimants receive advertising that exploits rather than informs. The vendor earns on volume; the attorney absorbs the quality risk; the claimant absorbs the expectation gap.

**Second Chair is designed to break this pattern at the level it controls.** Founders own the equity. Vendor success is tied to signed cases. The advertising serves the claimant.

Name this explicitly as a group: does this feel true? Is this a central part of why Second Chair exists — not just as a business opportunity but as a decision to build something that doesn't replicate the structure that produced each founder's worst professional experiences? What does it mean to all three of you to be on the other side of that equation for the first time?

**Your answer (all three founders responding):**

---

**The unified founder story:**
Each founder has a version of why Second Chair exists. After completing individual documents and comparing them, what is the one-paragraph version that all three can tell in their own voice and have it be true?

This is not a pitch. It is the honest version — the story you'd tell someone who asked you, privately, why you're doing this. It should contain the personal stakes (not just the business case), it should say something about what you're fighting against and what you're building toward, and it should be specific enough that someone hearing it would understand that these three people are not interchangeable with the founders of any other lead gen company.

Write a draft together. It doesn't have to be final — it's input for the agency team's synthesis.

**Your answer (all three founders responding):**

---

**The freedom of founder ownership:**
No private equity. No board. No stockholders. No one to answer to except the three of you, your attorney partners, and the claimants your advertising reaches.

How does that freedom change what Second Chair can say and do — specifically in sales conversations, in advertising, in how it treats clients — compared to a corporate-backed vendor? What would Second Chair do differently if it had taken a Series A? What decisions would already be off the table?

Name at least two specific things Second Chair can say or do because it has no external investors that a competitor with PE backing cannot.

**Your answer (all three founders responding):**

---

**The first-generation thread:**
All three founders have some proximity to the immigrant experience. Davis is navigating the US immigration system for his girlfriend. Sasha's grandparents came from Ukraine; his wife from Venezuela has navigated immigration directly. Alex's family has its own distance from immigrant origins.

The PI attorney demographic skews toward first and second generation immigrant founders — visible in the names of the firms, in the built-it-themselves origin stories. The B2C audience Second Chair will reach is often the same demographic. These are people who came from somewhere, built something, and are fighting for fair treatment from systems that weren't designed with them in mind.

Is there something real and worth naming here — a genuine connection between who the founders are, who the attorneys are, and who the claimants are? Not as a marketing claim. As an internal understanding of who Second Chair is for and why it understands them. What do all three founders see in this thread?

**Your answer (all three founders responding):**

---

**The consumer empowerment mandate — unified:**
What do all three founders believe Second Chair's B2C advertising should make an accident victim feel? Not the strategic answer. The personal one.

This person is working class or middle class. Often first or second generation. They've just been in an accident. The insurance adjuster is going to call. Most of what this person has absorbed from the culture tells them that fighting back is not worth it, that lawyers just take their cut, that the right move is to accept what they're offered.

When this person sees a Second Chair ad, what do all three founders want them to believe about their own power in that moment? What emotional state do you want to create? And: does this feel like something all three of you share — a genuine belief about what this advertising owes that person — or is it primarily Davis's conviction with Alex and Sasha aligned to it? Be honest about where the conviction is most real.

**Your answer (all three founders responding):**

---

**The 10-year vision:**
Not a market projection. What does the PI legal ecosystem look like in 10 years if Second Chair does its job fully?

What has changed for the PI attorney — how are they thought of, how are they sourcing clients, what does their relationship with a lead gen vendor look like? What has changed for the accident victim — what does honest PI advertising look like at scale, what does the 72-hour window feel like when someone actually has an advocate reaching them? What has changed for the category — has Second Chair's model forced competitors to change theirs, or built a wall that competitors can't cross because their business models can't support it?

And: what does it mean for all three of you personally if this works?

**Your answer (all three founders responding):**

## After You've Completed This Together

Once this document is filled out alongside all three individual input documents (`01_Davis_Input.md`, `02_Alex_Input.md`, `04_Sasha_Input.md`), all four go to the agency team for synthesis. Julian Cole and Jon Steel will produce two documents:

1. `Founding_Truth_Brief.md` — the strategic brief that Session 0 runs from
2. `05_Founder_DNA_Brief.md` — the emotional narrative of the founding team, captured as standing brand DNA for the full agency team

Session 0 will involve Davis, Julian Cole, and Jon Steel. Its job is to pressure-test the brief: where are the answers too vague? Where are they too safe? Where does the research point toward something the founders' answers haven't named yet?

The brief that comes out of Session 0 is the foundation every strategy session after it builds on. The quality of what comes out is directly proportional to the specificity and honesty of what went in.

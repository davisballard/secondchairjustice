## What This Is and Why It Matters

**Second Chair** is a PI (personal injury) lead generation company that Davis, Alex, and Sasha are building together. The premise: PI attorneys need cases. The existing lead gen category is broken — shared leads, misleading consumer advertising, opaque pricing, and a vendor revenue model that profits whether or not the attorney wins. Second Chair's model is different: honest consumer advertising, cost-per-signed-case measurement, and a product infrastructure that makes transparency real and durable.

**Why your input matters here specifically:** You are not just the person who executes Second Chair's promise — you are part of how Second Chair gets defined. Davis and Alex define it from the brand, product, and strategy side. You define it from the sales side: what the pitch sounds like, what an attorney needs to hear before they trust a new vendor, how a relationship gets built and kept, how the system needs to be structured for it to scale. Your input here shapes the product Alex builds, the materials Davis creates, and the way the company presents itself to the market. Every cold call you make, every client relationship you maintain, every attorney you sit across from — your conviction in those moments is as much a part of the brand as the advertising. A person can tell in 30 seconds whether someone believes what they're selling. This document is about making sure the team knows what you believe, where it comes from, and how to build around it.

**How to answer — voice is fine, and preferred:** You can answer any or all of these questions by recording a voice note or dictating via voice-to-text. No transcription needed — just send it to Davis and the system will organize it. If you go that route: say the question number out loud before you answer each one ("Question 1..." then your answer, "Question 2..." then your answer). It doesn't have to be polished. It doesn't have to be complete. It doesn't have to be in order. Talk as long as you want on the ones that feel important and skip any that don't land. Davis can work with rough, honest, and long — what he can't work with is short and vague. Say more than you think you need to.

If you prefer text: bullet points, rough notes, run-on sentences — any format is fine. No marketing language. Answer the way you'd answer if someone asked you this in a private conversation over a drink.

## Question 1: Your Path — The Choice You Made

You could have been a jeweler. The family business was there. It is a legitimate, stable, proven path — one that people you respect have taken. You chose to define your own path instead.

**What drove that decision?**

Not the surface answer — not "I wanted a challenge" or "I wanted to build something." The actual answer. What did you believe about who you were and what you were capable of that made the default path feel wrong? What did you have to give up or walk away from to make that choice? What did it cost you, and do you think it was worth it?

And: do you see a version of that same decision in the PI attorneys you'll be calling — people who chose a difficult, stigmatized profession when they could have done something safer and more respectable? What's the connection between how you made your choice and how they made theirs?

**Your answer:**

---

## Question 2: Your Daughter

You have a five-year-old daughter. You are building Second Chair during the years of her life when the world is still being defined for her.

**What does building this company mean in terms of the future you're trying to create — for her, and through her?**

Not the financial version (though that matters). The values version. What do you want her to understand about fighting for what's fair? About the difference between accepting what a system offers you and demanding what you're actually owed? About what it means to build something that tries to make a piece of the world more honest?

And: when you think about the accident victims Second Chair will reach — working parents in the 72 hours after a crash, trying to figure out what to do before the insurance adjuster has established the frame — do you think about your daughter? About who she might be in 25 years, and what you'd want to exist for her if she were in that position?

**Your answer:**

---

## Question 3: Your Family History and the Immigrant Thread

Your grandparents came from Ukraine. Your wife is from Venezuela and has navigated the US immigration system. Your family carries the history of people who came from somewhere else, built something here, and understood — from direct experience — what it means to have no power inside a system that doesn't recognize you.

**What does that history teach?**

Specifically: what do you know, from family stories or from your wife's direct experience, about what it feels like to be inside a system that has power over you and that doesn't automatically give you fair treatment? What did your grandparents or your wife have to do — or refuse to do — to get what they were owed?

And: many PI attorneys are first or second generation immigrants. You can see it in the last names — the Ukrainian names, the Eastern European names, the names that tell you these are people who had to build it themselves, who came here for opportunity and then created it rather than inheriting it. Do you think that history connects to what makes someone become a PI attorney — the fighter identity, the David vs. Goliath orientation, the willingness to take on a stigmatized profession to fight for people who have no one else? And does it connect to the claimants Second Chair will serve — working class, often first and second generation, navigating a system that wasn't designed for them?

**Your answer:**

---

## Question 4: Your Justice Orientation — The Personal Version

**Why do you specifically care about what happens to someone who gets in an accident and gets the insurance company's call before they've talked to anyone?**

Not the brand answer. The personal one. What side of that equation do you naturally stand on, and why? When you think about someone — maybe someone like people you know, or like your wife, or like the people your grandparents were — sitting across from an insurance adjuster who is offering them a settlement they don't understand, before they've consulted an attorney, what do you feel?

And: there is a version of this company that is just a well-run lead gen operation — efficient, profitable, no particular conviction behind it. Davis and Alex are building the version with conviction behind it. Why are you in that version instead of the other one? What is the difference to you between selling something you believe in and selling something you don't?

**Your answer:**

---

## Question 5: What You've Seen in the Room

You have spent years in high-volume sales and account management — direct outreach, discovery conversations, client relationships. You have been in a lot of rooms where someone was deciding whether to fight or accept.

**What do you know about that moment — the moment a person decides to fight rather than settle — that the rest of the team doesn't?**

Specifically:
- What does a PI attorney sound like when they've been burned by bad lead gen vendors and don't trust anyone yet? What do they need to hear, and what do they need to see, to lower that guard?
- What does a person sound like — in a sales conversation or a client relationship — when they're genuinely afraid versus when they're just negotiating? How do you tell the difference, and what changes in how you approach them?
- What is the moment in a cold call to a PI attorney where Second Chair either wins or loses the conversation? What is the thing that has to be true in that moment for it to go the right way?
- Have you ever talked someone into fighting for something they'd given up on? What was it, and what happened?

**Your answer:**

---

## Question 6: The Sales Conviction

**What is the difference between selling Second Chair and selling media buying for a generic brand?**

You've sold and managed accounts across a lot of verticals. For most of them, the product is the product — you believe in it enough to represent it well, but it isn't personal. Second Chair is different. Or it should be.

What will come through in a cold call to a PI attorney that wouldn't be there if you were selling programmatic media for a consumer packaged goods brand? Where does the conviction live in the pitch — not the words, but the place underneath the words where someone can hear whether you mean it?

And: what is the thing you can say to a PI attorney that no other lead gen salesperson in this category can say, because it would only be true if the company behind you was actually doing what Second Chair is doing?

**Your answer:**

---

## Question 7: Your Non-Negotiables in the Client Relationship

**What will you personally never do in a sales conversation or a client relationship, regardless of what it costs in revenue or what pressure you're under?**

These are not Second Chair's non-negotiables as a company (those are for the Together document). These are yours — the things that, if a client asked or a deal required them, you would refuse even if you lost the account.

Be specific. No hedging.

**Your answer:**

---

## Question 8: What This Means to You — The Version You Haven't Said Out Loud

Every person building a company has a version of why they're doing it that they don't fully articulate — because it sounds too personal, or too big, or because it hasn't quite found words yet.

**What is the version of why Second Chair matters to you that you haven't said out loud yet?**

This might be about your daughter. About your family history. About what you've seen in your career. About what you believe about how the world should work that the current world doesn't reflect. About the specific thing this company lets you do that you couldn't do anywhere else.

There are no wrong answers. This is the question designed to catch what all the others missed.

**Your answer:**

---

---

## Section A: Your Sales Profile

*Questions developed with Richard Roma (VP of Sales), who synthesizes 14 modern B2B sales frameworks. His job here is to understand how you naturally sell — not to prescribe a methodology, but to map your instincts against what already exists so Second Chair can build a sales system around your real strengths and identify exactly where you'll need training, context, or support.*

**Important framing:** You have not sold PI lead gen before. These questions are about your general selling style and instincts across the verticals you have sold in. The last question specifically asks you to reflect on what you think will transfer to PI and where the gaps are. Be honest — naming the gaps is as valuable as naming the strengths.

---

**Discovery and questioning style — your general approach:**

When you get a new B2B prospect on the phone for the first time (in any vertical), what are the first three things you try to understand? What question do you typically open with?

Do you tend to map their current situation vs. where they want to be, probe for pain through increasingly specific questions, or build need step by step? Describe how a first conversation flows when it's going well — not what you're supposed to do, what you actually do.

How long do you stay in discovery before you start presenting or pitching? What's the signal that tells you it's time to move forward?

What's the one question that consistently separates a real prospect from a time-waster — regardless of what you're selling?

**Your answer:**

---

**Cold outreach — what has actually worked:**

What's your preferred first-touch medium — call, email, LinkedIn, text? Why that one?

How many touches do you typically make before you move on? What does a full sequence look like when you're being systematic about it?

What opening line, subject line, or voicemail approach has actually gotten callbacks across the verticals you've worked in? Not the theory — the version that worked.

What's your voicemail strategy — do you leave one, and if so, what do you say?

**Your answer:**

---

**Objection handling and closing — your style:**

Are you a closer by pressure (assumptive language, direct asks, urgency) or by education (teaching them something that makes saying yes the logical conclusion)? When do you lean into each?

What's the sign — in someone's language, hesitation pattern, or energy — that tells you they're ready to close even before they say it?

When someone says "I need to think about it," what do you actually do — not what you're supposed to do?

What objection type do you handle best? What type still gives you trouble?

**Your answer:**

---

**Nurturing and relationship management:**

What does your follow-up cadence look like for a prospect who hasn't said yes or no? How long do you stay in it, and how do you keep touching them without annoying them?

Once a client signs with any company you've represented, what do you do in the first 30 days to make sure they stay? What's your check-in approach?

How do you turn a happy client into a referral — do you build a system, ask directly, or let it happen organically? What's worked?

What's your personal early warning sign that a client is going to churn before they say anything?

**Your answer:**

---

**Your natural style — the honest version:**

One word that describes how you sell.

The tactic or methodology you reflexively resist — even when it technically works for other people.

What you know about selling that most salespeople don't.

**Your answer:**

---

**The transfer question — PI lead gen specifically:**

You haven't sold PI lead gen before. Based on what you know about PI attorneys from Davis's research — burned by bad vendors, identity-sensitive about the ambulance-chaser stigma, buying decisions driven by trust and verification, multiple lead vendors running simultaneously — what do you think will carry over directly from how you've sold in other verticals?

And what do you think is genuinely different about this market that will require you to adapt, learn, or get specific support on before you start making calls?

**Your answer:**

---

## Section B: Your Media Buying Vision

*Questions developed with Simon Croft (Head of Media Buying), who frames media buying as a system of allocation decisions, kill criteria, and portfolio management — not ad-hoc execution. This section captures your media instincts and thinking on how they apply to Second Chair's specific context.*

**Important framing:** Your programmatic background is in consumer brands — cannabis, ASOS, Bose, Coach, Diageo, Tinder. You have not bought media in PI lead gen. The goal of this section is your vision for how Second Chair's media should operate and how your instincts transfer — not a proof of existing PI expertise. Where you don't know yet, say so. That's the most useful answer.

---

**Your platform experience and what transfers:**

You've bought across DSP/SSP platforms at scale and pioneered programmatic for cannabis when the major platforms were closed. What's your general approach to reaching a B2B professional audience (like PI attorneys) through paid media — what channels and targeting approaches do you reach for first, and why?

For B2C — reaching people who've just been in an accident, before the insurance adjuster has established their frame — how would you approach that targeting problem based on your experience? What channels are you confident in? What would you need to learn or test?

Are there channels or platforms you haven't worked with at depth that you think would be important for Second Chair? What do you want to explore?

**Your answer:**

---

**Budget philosophy and allocation:**

When you get a fixed monthly budget across channels, how do you decide where the first dollar goes? What's your general allocation logic?

Research suggests roughly 60% brand-building / 40% direct response as a long-term baseline for sustained effectiveness. Does that feel right for an early-stage company like Second Chair, or would you weight it differently at launch — and why?

What's your kill criteria — at what point do you cut a channel or a creative? How many days of data do you need before you're willing to pull something?

**Your answer:**

---

**Measurement — adapting to CPSC:**

Second Chair measures success by cost-per-signed-case, not cost-per-lead. You've measured CPL throughout your career. What changes operationally when the primary success metric is downstream of the lead — in how you bid, how you target, how you optimize, how you report to the team?

What does the reporting dashboard you need to make good allocation decisions look like? What data, at what cadence?

**Your answer:**

---

**Tools and infrastructure:**

What tools do you currently use for buying, tracking, and reporting that you'd bring to Second Chair from day one?

What do you need from Alex's product in terms of lead quality data flowing back from attorney accounts — what information would let you make better targeting and bidding decisions?

What tools or infrastructure does Second Chair need that doesn't exist yet and would need to be built?

**Your answer:**

---

**Honest gaps — PI specifically:**

What do you need to learn, research, or get educated on before you'd feel confident running Second Chair's PI media program? Name the specific gaps: compliance constraints (state bar advertising rules, TCPA, FTC), claimant behavioral patterns, B2B attorney targeting, geographic and DMA-level strategy — anything else. No hedging. Name the gaps so the team can figure out how to fill them before you're in market.

**Your answer:**

---

## Section C: What You Own, What You Need, What We Build Together

*This section is about operational accountability. It defines what you are personally committing to build and own, what you need from Davis and Alex to do your job effectively, and what needs to be built collaboratively. The goal is to come out of this with a clear picture of your first 90 days and what the team needs to build alongside you.*

---

**What you own — your personal commitments:**

Name the things you are fully accountable for building and maintaining at Second Chair — not a role description, but a personal commitment. Cold outreach infrastructure, CRM operations, media buying execution, client onboarding, account management, referral development — which of these are yours with no handoff?

What does your first 90 days look like specifically? What do you need to have built or operational by end of month one?

**Your answer:**

---

**What you need from Davis:**

Brand and messaging assets: what do you need from Davis — creative, copy, positioning documents, sales one-pagers, proof points, objection responses — before you can make a cold call with confidence?

Research access: what specific information from the brand research (attorney profiles, competitor analysis, CPSC benchmarks, market data) would make your outreach more effective? What do you need to be able to read and reference?

Collaboration cadence: how often do you want to sync with Davis, and on what? What does the feedback loop look like — you're in sales conversations, Davis is creating; what information do you need to pass back so the creative and messaging stays connected to what's actually happening in the market?

**Your answer:**

---

**What you need from Alex:**

CRM and tech stack: what CRM do you want to use, and what does Alex need to build or integrate to make it work with Second Chair's intake and reporting infrastructure?

Automation: what parts of your outreach, follow-up, or account management do you want automated? What do you need Alex to build for that?

Cursor and Claude — the honest conversation: Davis and Alex are building the entire Second Chair brand system in Cursor and Claude. All brand files, strategy documents, outreach checklists, and operational systems live there. To stay integrated with how the company works and to access and update shared files, you'll need to learn basic Cursor/Claude navigation — not to code, but to open files, read documents, update checklists, and contribute to shared systems. What do you need to make that transition manageable? What's your current comfort level with tools like this?

Performance data feedback: what does Alex need to build in the attorney-facing dashboard so that the data flowing back from accounts informs your media buying and outreach decisions in real time?

**Your answer:**

---

**Your dreams for the system:**

In 6 months, if everything is working, what does your sales and media operation look like? What does a day in your role feel like?

In 12–18 months, if Second Chair has proven the model in MVA and is ready to expand to adjacent verticals: what does your operation need to become to support that? What do you need to build now so that scale is possible without rebuilding from scratch?

Is there a part of the sales or media infrastructure that you've wanted to build in a previous role but never had the control or the resources to do it the right way? What would you build here that you couldn't build anywhere else?

**Your answer:**

---

## After You've Filled This Out

Send your completed answers to Davis. Format doesn't matter — rough is fine, Davis will handle the synthesis.

Once Davis has all three individual documents (his, Alex's, and yours), the three of you will do one session together — about 60–90 minutes — to answer the joint questions: the fusion, the shared non-negotiables, the founder story as a unified whole. That session is where all three individual inputs come together.

Questions: talk to Davis.

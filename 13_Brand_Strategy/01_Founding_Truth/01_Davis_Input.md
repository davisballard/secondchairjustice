# Founding Truth Input — Davis Ballard
## Complete Solo | Estimated Time: 1–2 Hours

**How to fill this out:**
The agency team has already read your résumé, your LinkedIn, and the background documents in `01_Identity/employees/DavisBallard.md`. This document is not a credentials summary. Every question here assumes you know your background — and is asking you to apply it. What does your advertising experience actually mean for what Second Chair can do? What does it look like specifically? What is the most recent, most relevant version of what you can do — not the most impressive thing on paper?

Answer as if you are talking to a smart person who has read everything about you and is asking the follow-up questions. Be specific. Be honest. Be recent. Ignore work from more than 5–6 years ago unless it directly illustrates something unique that more recent work doesn't capture better. Voice dictate if that's faster — raw is fine.

No marketing language. No mission-statement phrasing. If an answer starts to sound like a pitch deck, delete it and start over.

## Question 1: The Founding Moment

The research has documented the category problem in depth — the Six Cardinal Sins of lead gen, the attorney identity wound, the exploitation of claimants, the CPSC gap. That's the abstract problem. This question is about the personal one.

**What specific moment — a conversation, something you read, a problem you saw firsthand, a piece of advertising that made you angry or embarrassed — made Second Chair feel not just necessary but *inevitable for you specifically*?**

What did you observe that someone else in the room would have walked past? What was the moment you saw the gap between what advertising could be and what the PI lead gen category was actually doing — and felt that you, specifically, were the person to close it?

*(Don't describe the market problem. Describe the moment you saw it and felt something specific about it. One story is worth more than a paragraph of category analysis.)*

**Your answer:**

## Question 2: The Advertising Capability — Made Specific

The positioning draft in the research synthesis reads: *"We have the creative pedigree — 18 years building advertising for Disney, Google, Samsung — and the business model aligned with attorney outcomes."*

That's the credential. This question is about the application.

**What specific things can you do as an advertising strategist and creative director — things you've actually done, not things you theoretically know — that no PI lead gen vendor has ever done or thought to do?**

Don't describe your résumé. Describe the capability. Think about:

- A campaign decision you made for a global brand that changed how you think about what advertising is supposed to do. What was the decision, what was the insight behind it, and how does it apply directly to what Second Chair will do for a PI attorney?
- A strategic framework or way of thinking about consumer behavior that you developed or refined through your global brand work — one that the PI lead gen category has never applied because they don't know it exists.
- The difference between how you think about a consumer brief and how a typical lead gen vendor thinks about it. Be specific about what you see that they miss.
- The most recent work that is most directly applicable to what Second Chair will build. What is it and why does it apply?

*(Concrete is better than comprehensive. Two real examples with depth beat eight impressive-sounding claims.)*

## Question 3: The Creative and Brand Hypotheses

You have working assumptions right now about what Second Chair should look like, sound like, and feel like. These are hypotheses — the strategy sessions will pressure-test them. But they matter because they represent your current best creative intuition, built from everything you know about advertising and this market.

**What are your current working hypotheses about Second Chair's brand?**

Address each of these — even if your answer is "I don't know yet" or "I have a gut feeling but can't articulate it":

**Voice:** What does Second Chair sound like? Not a list of adjectives — a description of register. How does it talk to a PI attorney? What does it never say? What does it say that no other vendor in the category has ever said? If you have a sentence or a line that feels close to the brand's voice, write it down.

**Visual direction:** What does Second Chair look like? Not a mood board — a description of the visual grammar. What are the signals that tell a PI attorney this brand is different from every other vendor they've seen? What visual conventions of the PI advertising category does Second Chair refuse to use?

**Campaign concept:** If you had to run one campaign for Second Chair starting tomorrow — B2B or B2C, your choice — what is the concept? Rough is fine. The idea, the medium, and why it works.

**The one hypothesis you're most confident about:** Name it. What do you believe about Second Chair's brand that you'd be willing to stake the strategy on?

**The one hypothesis you're least confident about:** What's the assumption you're carrying that you know needs to be tested against the research and the team?

*(If you've done visual research or have visual references collected, name them here. Don't try to describe images in words — just reference where they live so the creative team can find them.)*

**Your answer:**

## Question 4: The Justice Orientation — Your Personal Version

The research found that Second Chair's honest advertising purpose is structurally genuine — not a marketing decision, but a consequence of the business model. The CPSC alignment means a bad claimant costs Second Chair as much as it costs the attorney. That's the systemic version.

This question is about your personal version.

**What do you believe the advertising supply chain owes the people inside it — the accident victims and the attorneys — and why do you specifically feel that obligation?**

This is not the external brand claim. It is the internal compass. Answer it the way you'd answer it in a private conversation, not in a pitch. Specifically:

- What does it mean to you that PI advertising — advertising that reaches people at their most vulnerable — is currently built to exploit that vulnerability? Not abstractly: what do you feel about it?
- What does Second Chair owe the accident victim who sees one of its ads? What does "honest advertising" actually mean in practice — not as a brand position, but as a commitment you'd make to a real person?
- What does Second Chair owe the attorney who trusts it with their practice's growth? Where does the obligation begin and end?
- Is there a version of Second Chair that you would not want to build — a version that technically works as a business but violates what you believe the brand should be?

*(This question produces the internal compass. The brand's external expression of justice will be built from the strategy sessions. But the sessions need to know what the founders actually believe — not what sounds right.)*

**Your answer:**

## Question 5: Non-Negotiables — Yours

These are the things Second Chair will never do regardless of competitive pressure, short-term revenue opportunity, or a good argument from a smart person. They are not strategic positions — they can't be negotiated away if the market shifts. They are ethical commitments that the business model and your values make permanent.

**Name the things Second Chair will never do. Be specific. No hedging.**

Some starting prompts to work from — these are not the answers, they are the direction:
- Will Second Chair ever run advertising that implies a settlement value before talking to the client?
- Will Second Chair ever sell shared leads?
- Will Second Chair ever use actors presenting as real clients?
- Will Second Chair ever hide its pricing from an attorney prospect?
- Will Second Chair ever take a client it doesn't believe it can genuinely serve?
- Will Second Chair ever prioritize lead volume over case quality to hit a short-term revenue number?

Add anything this list doesn't cover. The non-negotiables you name here will be tested in the strategy sessions — not to challenge them, but to make them structurally real.

**Your answer:**

## Question 6: What You Already Know That You Haven't Said Yet

This is the open question. Every founder knows something about their business, their market, or their capability that hasn't made it into a document yet — because it hasn't been asked the right way, or because it seems too obvious to say, or because it's a feeling rather than a fact.

**What do you know about Second Chair — or about what you can do, or about what the PI advertising market needs — that you haven't been able to say explicitly yet?**

There are no wrong answers here. This is the question designed to catch what all the other questions missed.

**Your answer:**

---

## Question 7: The Personal Conviction — Why This Is a Vocation, Not a Job

Everything above was about capability. This is about character. The strategy team needs to understand not just what you can do but why you are the right person — specifically — to do it, and what that conviction will make visible in the brand that no other vendor in this category can match.

No marketing language. No mission statement phrasing. Answer the way you'd answer if someone asked you this in a private conversation.

**The justice anger — specific:**
Your dad was convinced by the mass tort advertising narrative that PI attorneys are ambulance chasers. That's not an accident. Insurance corporations have spent billions lobbying their own framing into the culture — convincing the people these attorneys fight for that the fighters are the villains. That is a specific, documentable, deliberate act of corporate propaganda. What does that make you feel? Not about the market — about the people behind it. Where does that anger come from, and how long have you carried it?

Broader: you see a pattern — housing consolidated into private equity portfolios, trickle-down economics presented as good for everyone, a generation that paid into insurance systems their whole lives and gets nickels and dimes when something actually happens. Why does this specifically enrage you beyond the political? What is the personal dimension?

**Your answer:**

---

**The underappreciation parallel — with structural nuance:**
You built the Vacation brand. The whole thing. You didn't get equity because you left before the vesting cliff. That is not a villain story — the founder of Vacation wanted to make it big too, and was working within financial constraints that prevented him from being more generous with credit and ownership. That's the structural reality of employment: value created by one person flows to whoever controls the economics, not automatically back to the creator.

You know this feeling. You have done work that most people in this industry could not do — for Disney, Google, Samsung, Vacation — and the conventional scoreboard (net worth, equity, visible financial outcome) didn't reflect it. Your parents looked at a résumé that would make most advertising people envious and saw someone who hadn't made the million.

Here's the question: PI attorneys experience a version of this. They do consequential, technically demanding, emotionally costly work — fighting for people who had nowhere else to turn — and the culture brands them ambulance chasers. Society looks at a profession that changes people's lives and sees bottom-feeders. That is the same mechanism. How does your personal experience of having your contribution dismissed by a system that only recognizes certain kinds of scoreboard connect to what these attorneys experience? What do you understand about that feeling that someone who went straight from school to a high-paying corporate title wouldn't?

**Your answer:**

**The cycle Second Chair breaks — and why that's intentional:**
The Vacation founder's constraints produced a situation where you didn't get the equity you earned. TradeStation's business priorities shifted and Alex's role ended after he built something exceptional. The PI lead gen category's misaligned incentives produce a situation where attorneys don't get what they pay for and claimants don't get what they deserve. This is the same pattern at every level — the person creating the value and the person controlling the economics are structurally separated, and the value doesn't flow back.

Second Chair is designed to break this pattern at the level it controls. Founders own the equity. Vendor success is tied to attorney case outcomes, not lead volume. The advertising serves the claimant. Nobody in this system absorbs someone else's misaligned incentive structure.

Is the conscious decision to not pass this down part of what drives the company for you? What does it mean to build something where, for the first time, you control both the work and the economics that come from it?

**Your answer:**

---

**Starting Second Chair as an act of defiance:**
This is not just a business. It is a decision to stop building other people's brands — with your capability, your ideas, your creative and strategic intelligence — and start building something that reflects what you actually believe, where the value you create comes back to you.

What does that mean to you personally? Not the strategic version — the private one. What did it feel like to decide to stop, to go out on your own, to put your name on something rather than on someone else's?

**Your answer:**

---

**The consumer empowerment mandate:**
When a Second Chair ad reaches an accident victim — in the 72 hours after the crash, before the insurance adjuster has established their frame — what do you want that person to feel? Not what do you want them to do (call). What do you want them to feel?

These are often working class people. First and second generation. People who give a lot to a system that doesn't give a lot back. People who have been told — by the adjuster's call, by the settlement offer, by the culture — that fighting back isn't worth it, that lawyers are just trying to take their cut, that the right move is to accept what they're given and move on.

What is the emotional state you want them to be in after seeing a Second Chair ad? What do you want them to believe about their own power in that moment?

**Your answer:**

---

**The first-generation thread — lightly:**
You are currently navigating the US immigration system for your girlfriend. That is a lived, firsthand experience of what it means to be inside a bureaucratic system that moves on its own timeline regardless of fairness, where power sits entirely on one side, and where the outcome depends heavily on whether you know how to navigate the rules.

The accident victims Second Chair will reach are often in a structurally similar position — working class to middle class, often first or second generation, inside a claims process that was designed by the insurance company to favor the insurance company. Does your immigration experience inform at all how you think about what it feels like to be that person? Does it change anything about how you'd want the advertising to speak to them?

*(Light prompt — capture whatever is actually true here, even if the answer is short.)*

# Founding Truth Pre-Brief: Process Guide

**What this folder is:**
The Founding Truth Brief (Session 0 in the Brand Strategy Roadmap) cannot run on research alone. It requires direct input from the founding team — the kind of specific, honest, unadorned answers that no LinkedIn profile, résumé, or prior conversation can fully provide. This folder captures those answers before the strategy sessions begin.

**Why five documents:**
Not every question can be answered by the same person, or in the same setting. Each founder's individual input is richer when produced independently, before comparing with the others. The Together document integrates what the individual documents produced. The DNA Brief is the agency team's synthesis of the emotional narrative — separate from the strategic brief because it serves a different purpose.

## The Documents and Who Completes Them

### `01_Davis_Input.md` — Davis completes solo
Questions only Davis can answer: the founding moment, his specific advertising experience and how it applies, his creative and brand hypotheses, his non-negotiables, his justice orientation, and his personal conviction — why this is a vocation, not a job.

**Time:** 1.5–2 hours. Voice dictate if that's faster — raw is fine. What matters is specificity, not polish.

**The key instruction:** The agency team has already read your résumé and LinkedIn. This document is not a credentials summary. Choose the most recent, most relevant, most honest version of what you know and believe. Ignore impressive-sounding things from the past that don't directly apply.

---

### `02_Alex_Input.md` — Alex completes solo (self-contained, sendable)
Designed to be sent to Alex directly — he needs no prior context, no other files, and no briefing call. The document opens with a full explanation of what Second Chair is, what the research found, and why his input matters now.

Questions cover: what each research tension makes him want to build, his specific technical competitive advantages, MVP thinking, product hypotheses, honest gaps — and his personal conviction: the story from his life, the underappreciation parallel, why this market specifically.

**How to send it:** Copy the text into a message, email, or shared doc. Tell Alex: "Fill this out in whatever format works — voice memo, rough notes, bullet points. Don't try to make it polished. I'll synthesize from there."

**Time:** 1.5–2 hours on his end.

---

### `04_Sasha_Input.md` — Sasha completes solo (self-contained, sendable)
Designed to be sent to Sasha directly — fully self-contained, no prior context needed.

Questions cover: the path he chose (over the family jewelry business), his daughter and what he's building for her future, his family's immigrant history (Ukrainian Jewish grandparents, wife from Venezuela), his justice orientation, what he's learned from years of sales conversations about the moment someone decides to fight, the sales conviction question, and what this means to him that he hasn't said out loud yet.

**How to send it:** Copy the text into a message, email, or shared doc. Same instruction as Alex — rough is fine.

**Time:** 60–90 minutes on his end.

### `03_Founders_Together.md` — All three founders, after individual documents are complete
This document cannot be started until `01_Davis_Input.md`, `02_Alex_Input.md`, and `04_Sasha_Input.md` are all done. Its questions require all three founders in the same conversation — comparing and integrating individual inputs.

Questions cover: the structural parallel (what all three founders have lived and how it maps onto the PI lead gen category), the unified founder story, shared non-negotiables, honest limitations, the expansion thesis, the first-generation thread, and the consumer empowerment mandate.

**Format:** A call, a voice session, or a back-and-forth written exchange. Plan for 90–120 minutes — this document is larger than the original Together document.

---

### `05_Founder_DNA_Brief.md` — Agency team completes (Julian Cole + Jon Steel)
This is not a questionnaire. It is the emotional synthesis — the agency team's distillation of everything the four founder input documents produced, organized as standing brand DNA for the full agency team.

It covers: the structural parallel (what the founders have lived and why it makes them uniquely qualified to serve this market), the vocation statement, the consumer empowerment mandate, the freedom of founder ownership, the first-generation thread, and how all of this manifests in the brand's work without being explicitly named.

**When it's produced:** Alongside `Founding_Truth_Brief.md`, after all four founder documents are collected and Session 0 has run.

**Who reads it:** The full agency team. Referenced in every creative, strategy, and sales deliverable.

## The Sequence

```
Step 1 — Davis completes 01_Davis_Input.md (solo, 1.5–2 hrs)
Step 2 — Alex completes 02_Alex_Input.md (solo, 1.5–2 hrs) [runs parallel with Step 1]
Step 2 — Sasha completes 04_Sasha_Input.md (solo, 60–90 min) [runs parallel with Steps 1 and 2]
        ↓
Step 3 — All three founders complete 03_Founders_Together.md (together, 90–120 min)
        ↓
Step 4 — Agency team synthesizes all four into:
         → Founding_Truth_Brief.md (strategic brief)
         → 05_Founder_DNA_Brief.md (emotional brand DNA)
        ↓
Step 5 — Session 0 runs: Julian Cole + Jon Steel pressure-test the brief with Davis
        ↓
Brand Strategy Sessions 1–4 begin
```

Steps 1, 2, and Sasha's document all run in parallel. None of them require the others to be complete first.

Step 3 cannot run until all three individual documents are complete.

## What Happens After All Four Are Complete

Once all four documents are filled out, the agency team (Julian Cole + Jon Steel) produces two synthesis documents:

**`Founding_Truth_Brief.md`** — The strategic brief Session 0 runs from. This document:
- Identifies where the founders' inputs align strongly (the core of the founding truth)
- Surfaces where they diverge or are incomplete (the questions Session 0 presses hardest)
- Flags any hypotheses that contradict the research findings (these get pressure-tested, not discarded)
- Produces the 8-section brief in the format defined in `00_Brand_Strategy_Roadmap.md`, Session 0

**`05_Founder_DNA_Brief.md`** — The emotional narrative brief. This document:
- Articulates the structural parallel between the founders' personal experiences and what PI attorneys and claimants experience
- Captures the vocation statement and the consumer empowerment mandate
- Documents the first-generation thread and how it connects founders, attorneys, and claimants
- Becomes the standing reference the full agency team uses for every creative and strategy decision

Both documents are internal only. Neither is client-facing.

## One Instruction That Applies to All Three Documents

**No marketing language.**

Do not write answers the way you'd write a pitch deck or a LinkedIn post. Write the way Jon Steel would extract it — as if you are being deposed. If you catch yourself writing something that sounds good rather than something that is true, delete it and start again. The strategy sessions produce the version that sounds good. These documents produce the version that is real.

# Second Chair Image Generation Style Guide
## Davis's Preferences for Nevada/Jacoby & Meyers Campaigns

> **Purpose:** This document captures the visual style, approach, and specific details that should be applied to ALL image generation for Second Chair ads. Follow these guidelines on first run — no reprompting needed.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST

**EVERY image generated for Second Chair MUST follow this style guide.**

Do NOT generate bland, stock-looking, generic AI images. They will be rejected.

Before generating ANY image:
1. **Read the full prompt examples** in this guide (Section 10)
2. **Include Nevada-specific details** (tan stucco, desert, harsh sunlight)
3. **Include 3-5 Easter eggs** (absurd background details)
4. **Use amateur iPhone quality** language in prompts
5. **Match the specific ad angle** (Settlement Gap = show the GAP, Fighter = show the FIGHT)

**If an image looks like it could be from any stock photo site, it's WRONG.**

---

## 1. CORE PHILOSOPHY

### ⚠️ IMAGES MUST MATCH THE SPECIFIC TOPIC
**DO NOT** just repeat the same template for every ad. Each ad has a unique angle — the images must reflect THAT angle.

**Examples:**
- "Settlement Gap" ad → Show the GAP (numbers, before/after)
- "48-Hour Call Tactic" ad → Show the CALL (phone ringing, timeline, stressed person on phone)
- "Evidence Disappears" ad → Show TIME PRESSURE (clock, fading evidence, urgency)
- "Fighter" ad → Show the FIGHT (person standing proud, victory moment)

**Before generating, ask:** What is the SPECIFIC ANGLE of this ad's copy? Then design images that visualize THAT angle.

### Aggression Level
- **PUSH IT.** Nevada allows more than California — use the latitude
- Maximum scroll-stopping power at all times
- Loud, urgent, attention-demanding
- Nothing safe, nothing corporate, nothing polished

### Authenticity Over Polish
- Real people, not models
- Amateur photography quality, not DSLR/professional
- "Someone's wife took this on her iPhone" energy
- Imperfections are features, not bugs

---

## 2. ASPECT RATIO

**Default: 4:5 (vertical)**
- Optimal for Meta feed (Facebook + Instagram)
- Takes up more screen real estate on mobile
- Do NOT use 1:1 unless specifically requested

---

## 3. NEVADA IDENTITY (Location Triggers)

### DO Use:
- Tan/beige stucco homes
- Desert gravel landscaping (rocks, cacti, no grass)
- Spring Mountains visible in distance
- Red Rock Canyon tones on horizon
- Clear deep blue Nevada sky
- Harsh desert sunlight
- Las Vegas suburb residential (Henderson, North Las Vegas)
- Vegas Strip for reflections/backgrounds (nighttime)

### DO NOT Use:
- Lush palm trees and green grass (looks California)
- Generic suburban that could be anywhere
- Tourist-focused Strip imagery (too obvious)

---

## 4. PEOPLE / PORTRAIT STYLE

### Demographics
- Age: 35-50 (working class Nevada resident)
- Natural weathered face from desert sun
- Authentic imperfections — NOT model-perfect
- Casual work clothes (jeans, t-shirt, polo)

### Injuries (Nevada Allows This)
- Show visible injuries: arm slings, bandages, casts
- Person should be HAPPY/PROUD despite injury
- Victorious expression, not sad or distressed
- "This guy fought back and WON" energy

### Photography Style
- Shot on older iPhone (iPhone 8/X quality)
- Slight grain, softer focus
- Amateur snapshot energy
- Off-center framing, not perfectly composed
- Motion blur acceptable
- Natural harsh lighting with hard shadows
- "His wife just took this photo" vibe

### Crashed Vehicles
- Show damaged cars (dented hood, cracked bumper, broken headlight)
- Person standing proud next to the evidence
- Nevada allows crash footage — use it

---

## 5. EASTER EGGS (Background Details)

Always include 3-5 ridiculous/absurd details in backgrounds that reward viewers who look closely.

**⚠️ VARY THESE EVERY TIME — don't repeat the same ones.**

### Example Pool (Mix It Up):
- Cactus wearing sunglasses
- Pink flamingo lawn ornament
- Nosy neighbor peeking through blinds
- Random cat sitting on fence watching
- Kid's bike left in driveway
- Deflated pool flamingo on ground
- Funny bumper sticker on parked car
- Garden gnome in weird position
- Dog watching from window
- Sprinkler going off randomly
- Someone watering dead plants
- Mailbox with too much mail stuffed in
- Lawn chair blown over
- Kid's toy left on lawn
- "Beware of Dog" sign but tiny chihuahua visible
- Someone BBQing in the background
- Moving truck half-packed
- Garage sale signs
- Someone washing their car
- Delivery package on wrong porch

### The Point:
Pick 3-5 DIFFERENT ones each time. The goal is absurd details that reward looking — not the same details repeated.

### Purpose:
- Makes people stop and look
- Increases engagement and comments
- Creates shareability
- Differentiates from generic stock imagery

---

## 6. SCREENSHOT / TEXT MESSAGE STYLE

### Format
- **Photo OF the phone** (not a flat screenshot)
- Hand holding the phone visible
- Phone at casual asymmetrical angle (not perfectly straight)
- Shot with older iPhone camera (iPhone 8/X quality, not DSLR)

### Screen Details
**⚠️ VARY THESE — use funny/memorable numbers, don't repeat the same ones.**

- **Time:** Use amusing times (examples: 4:20, 11:11, 3:33, 12:34, 7:11, 9:11 PM)
- **Battery:** Use funny percentages (examples: 69%, 1%, 100%, 42%, 13%, 77%)
- **Contact name:** Vary the name with visible avatar (examples: Danny, Mike, Jake, Carlos, Tommy)
- Dark mode iMessage

The goal is small details that feel real and make people smile — not the exact same numbers every time.

### Vegas Integration
- Las Vegas Strip lights visible as **REFLECTION** on phone glass
- Person is outside on the Strip taking this photo
- Subtle neon glow reflected in screen
- NOT a wallpaper — an actual reflection

### Conversation Style
- Active busy thread (looks like they talk often)
- Multiple messages, no dead space
- Text must be LARGE and LEGIBLE
- Zoomed in so text is readable on feed

### Example Conversation Flow:
```
Gray: "They offered me $3,200"
Gray: "That's it??"
Blue: "Attorney just called. Settlement: $127,000"
Gray: "Holy shit"
```

---

## 7. INFOGRAPHIC / NUMBERS STYLE

### Split Frame Approach
- **LEFT = Bad Outcome**
  - Small defeated number (e.g., $2,500)
  - Sad/frustrated face
  - Crashed damaged car visible
  - Muted, dark, depressing colors
  - "INSURANCE OFFERED" label

- **RIGHT = Good Outcome**
  - MASSIVE triumphant number (e.g., $127,500)
  - Happy/relieved face celebrating
  - Bright, energetic, winning colors
  - "CASE SETTLED FOR" label

### Design Elements
- Thick dramatic arrow connecting left to right
- CHUNKY aggressive typography (tabloid headline energy)
- Feels URGENT like breaking news
- Clearly about AUTO ACCIDENTS (show cars)
- Nevada desert backdrop visible

### Colors
- Left: Muted red/rust, dimmed
- Right: Electric green or gold, saturated
- High contrast, PUNCHY, not subtle

---

## 8. VIDEO CLIP CONTINUITY

**For TikTok Slide videos (3 clips), the SAME person must appear across all clips.**

### Why This Matters
- Clip 1: Hook (POV or person reacting)
- Clip 2: Action (person in situation)
- Clip 3: Victory (SAME person celebrating)

If Clip 2 shows a 40yo Nevada man with a cast, Clip 3 must show that SAME man celebrating — not a different person.

### How to Maintain Continuity
In prompts for Clips 2 and 3, repeat the key descriptors:
- Same age, gender, appearance
- Same injury (cast, sling, etc.)
- Same clothing style
- "same man/woman as before"

### Example
**Clip 2:** "40-year-old Nevada man with cast on arm, standing defiant..."
**Clip 3:** "same 40-year-old Nevada man with cast on arm, celebrating outside courthouse..."

**Documentation:** `03_Dept_Production_Studio/AI_Creative_Director/Text_Overlay_System.md` (Parts 7-10)

### Recommended Styles for Second Chair

| Ad Type | Headline Style | CTA Style |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **Deadline Urgency** | `headline_condensed` (Trade Gothic) | `cta_punch` (Franklin Gothic) |
| **Trust/Authority** | `headline_trust` (Baskerville) | `cta_trust` (Baskerville) |

    image_path="nevada_scene.png",
    text="Time Is Running Out",
    position="top_center",
    style="headline_condensed"
)

# Trust/authority with template
result = apply_template(
    image_path="base.png",
    template="trust_authority",
    content={
        "headline": "Accident Victims May Be Entitled To Compensation",
        "supporting": "No upfront costs. Free case review.",
        "cta": "Get Your Free Estimate →"
    }
)
```

### Typography Philosophy for Second Chair

1. **Baskerville for Trust** — Research shows people perceive statements in Baskerville as more believable. Use for authority claims.

2. **Franklin Gothic / Trade Gothic for Urgency** — Bold, American, no-nonsense. Use for deadline and action content.

3. **Futura for CTAs** — Clean geometric action. High conversion, clear intent.

4. **Never use generic fonts** — No Arial, no Impact (unless for very specific scroll-stop hooks). Use the classics.

### Safe Zones (Platform UI)

| Platform | Avoid |
|----------|-------|
| TikTok (9:16) | Bottom 20% (controls), Top 5% (time/signal) |
| Meta Feed (1:1) | Bottom 10% (controls) |
| Meta Stories (9:16) | Same as TikTok |
| YouTube (16:9) | Bottom 15% (controls, scrubber) |

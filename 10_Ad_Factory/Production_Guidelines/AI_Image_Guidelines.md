# AI Image Generation: Behavioral Science Playbook

> **Purpose:** Every image must trigger at least 3 psychological principles. This isn't about "making pretty pictures" — it's about engineering scroll-stopping, trust-building, action-driving visual triggers.
>
> **The Rule:** If you can't name the behavioral principles an image activates, don't generate it.

## The 7 Visual Triggers

Every high-performing ad image activates multiple psychological triggers. Master these seven and layer them into every creative.

---

### 1. PROCESSING FLUENCY DISRUPTION

**The Science:** The brain processes polished ads as "someone trying to SELL me" (System 2 activation → defenses UP). Lo-fi signals "someone trying to TELL me" (System 1 processing → defenses DOWN).

**What This Means:**
- High-production images get filtered as ads
- "Imperfect" images bypass the advertising filter
- Platform-native aesthetics feel like content, not interruption

**Prompt Keywords:**
```
iPhone photo, smartphone quality, candid moment, natural lighting,
slightly off-center, documentary style, unpolished, raw, messy background,
imperfect framing, motion blur, slight grain, caught mid-action
```

**Negative Prompts:**
```
studio lighting, 4K, 8K, cinematic, professional, polished, stock photo,
perfect composition, centered, rendered, CGI, advertising style
```

**The Paradox:** Slight AI artifacts can *help* by reinforcing "amateur" aesthetic. Imperfection = authenticity signal.

---

### 2. MIRROR NEURON ACTIVATION

**The Science:** Humans are wired to recognize and mirror emotional states in faces. When we see a face showing stress, relief, or hope — our brain simulates that emotion.

**What This Means:**
- Show the EMOTION your audience is feeling right now
- Tired, stressed, relieved faces mirror the accident victim's state
- "Model-perfect" faces trigger "this is an ad" defenses

**Face Requirements:**
| Attribute | Do This | Not This |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Expression** | Tired, stressed, relieved, hopeful | Stock-photo smile |
| **Features** | Natural skin texture, slight asymmetry | Airbrushed, symmetrical |
| **Age** | 35-55 (MVA audience match) | Model-young |
| **Feeling** | "Someone like me" | "Someone selling to me" |

**Prompt Keywords:**
```
natural appearance, slight imperfections, tired but hopeful expression,
real person feeling, NOT model, NOT stock photo, lived-in face,
authentic emotion, age-appropriate, regional diversity
```

**Gaze Direction Psychology:**
| Gaze | Brain Response | Use For |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Direct at camera | Attention locks on face | Trust-building, connection |
| Looking at text/CTA | Eye follows to element | Directing to action |
| Averted shock (off-screen) | Curiosity gap created | Pattern interrupt |

---

### 3. LOSS AVERSION FRAMING

**The Science:** Losses hurt 2x more than equivalent gains feel good (Kahneman & Tversky). Visual framing determines whether the brain processes information as potential loss or potential gain.

**What This Means:**
- Show the AFTERMATH, not the moment of impact
- Imply what could be LOST without action
- Recovery framing reduces defensiveness while maintaining urgency

**Visual Loss Framing:**
| Concept | Loss Frame (DO) | Gain Frame (WEAKER) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Accident aftermath | Empty intersection, damaged vehicle alone | Happy family in new car |
| Medical bills | Stack of unopened envelopes, stressed posture | Person relaxing |
| Legal help | Person looking at documents with concern | Smiling in attorney's office |
| Missed deadline | Calendar with date circled, worried expression | "On time" celebration |

**Safe Aftermath Concepts:**
```
Empty intersection where accident happened
Damaged vehicle in empty parking lot
Stack of medical bills/legal documents (blurred text)
Person at kitchen table surrounded by paperwork
Phone showing missed calls from unknown numbers
Calendar with deadline circled
Recovery: cast with signatures, physical therapy, home rest
```

---

### 4. SOCIAL PROOF SIGNALING

**The Science:** People look to others' behavior to determine correct action (Cialdini). Visual cues of "others like me chose this" reduce perceived risk and accelerate decision.

**What This Means:**
- Implied peer validation beats explicit claims
- "Real people" environments signal authenticity
- Avoid isolated, solo imagery when possible

**Visual Social Proof Cues:**
| Cue Type | Visual Execution |
|----------|------------------|
| Peer validation | Multiple people in frame, community settings |
| Testimonial implication | Person speaking to camera, conversation posture |
| Shared experience | Kitchen table discussions, waiting room togetherness |
| Family involvement | Loved ones in background showing concern/support |

**Environment Signals:**
```
Kitchen table with family present
Living room couch conversation
Coffee shop meeting
Car interior phone conversation (not driving)
Home office with personal items visible
```

---

### 5. URGENCY & SCARCITY VISUALIZATION

**The Science:** Scarcity increases perceived value and accelerates action (Worchel Cookie Jar Study). Time pressure activates fear of missing out and bypasses analytical delay.

**What This Means:**
- Visual time cues create psychological deadline
- "Running out" signals trigger action
- Urgency must feel REAL, not manufactured

**Visual Urgency Elements:**
| Element | Visual Treatment |
|---------|------------------|
| Time pressure | Clocks, calendars, phone showing time, sunset/dusk lighting |
| Deadline implication | Circled dates, sticky notes, reminder alerts on screen |
| Opportunity window | Door ajar, light streaming through gap, "last chance" body language |
| Scarcity of help | Single person available to help, "one attorney" feeling |

**Authentic Urgency Keywords:**
```
Deadline approaching, urgent expression, time-sensitive moment,
limited window, before it's too late energy, now-or-never posture
```

---

### 6. AUTHORITY & TRUST SIGNALING

**The Science:** People defer to perceived experts and authority figures (Milgram). Trust badges and institutional signals reduce perceived risk.

**What This Means:**
- Professional environment cues without "corporate cold"
- Subtle authority signals (office, documents, professional dress)
- Warmth + competence = optimal trust

**Trust Environment Elements:**
| Element | Signal Strength | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Law office setting | HIGH | Books, documents, professional but warm |
| Professional attire | MEDIUM | Not suit-and-tie formal, approachable professional |
| Home environment | HIGH (for "real person") | Authenticity over authority |
| Official documents | MEDIUM | Implied legitimacy (blur text) |

**Balance Formula:**
> Authority Without Coldness = Professional setting + warm lighting + natural human moment

---

### 7. EMOTIONAL RESONANCE TARGETING

**The Science:** Emotions shape decisions more than logic (Damasio Somatic Marker Hypothesis). The specific emotion triggered determines the action taken.

**Emotion → Action Mapping:**
| Target Emotion | Visual Cues | Triggers Action |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| FEAR (moderate) | Uncertainty, looming deadline, isolation | Seeking protection |
| RELIEF | Exhale moment, weight lifted, light entering | Accepting help |
| HOPE | Dawn/sunrise, path forward, door opening | Taking first step |
| ANGER (controlled) | Injustice implied, unfair situation | Fighting back |
| EMPATHY | Vulnerability shown, shared struggle | Connection, sharing |

**Emotional Lighting Palette:**
| Emotion | Lighting | Color Temperature |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Fear/Concern | Harsh shadows, uneven light | Cool (blue-ish) |
| Relief/Hope | Soft, even, warm | Golden hour warm |
| Urgency | High contrast, dramatic | Mixed temperatures |
| Trust | Natural window light | Neutral to warm |

## The Behavioral Layer System

Every image should layer multiple triggers. Here's how to stack them:

### Layer 1: Base Authenticity
- Processing fluency disruption (lo-fi aesthetic)
- Platform-native feel
- "Content not ad" signal

### Layer 2: Emotional Core
- Mirror neuron activation (face/expression)
- Emotional resonance targeting
- Specific emotion → specific action

### Layer 3: Action Drivers
- Loss aversion framing
- Urgency visualization
- Social proof or authority cues

### Minimum Viable Trigger Stack
**Every image must activate at least 3 of the 7 triggers.**

Example prompt building:
```
Base: "iPhone photo quality, candid moment, natural lighting, messy background"
+ Emotional: "middle-aged woman, tired but hopeful expression, slight imperfections"
+ Action: "looking at stack of documents with concern, kitchen table setting"
+ Social: "family member visible in background, worried but supportive"
```

## Platform-Specific Behavioral Optimization

### Meta Feed (1:1, 4:5)
**Goal:** Stop the scroll in 0.3 seconds

- **Dominant trigger:** Mirror neuron (face center-frame)
- **Support triggers:** Processing fluency + emotional resonance
- **Text overlay:** Under 20% — let image carry emotion, copy carries logic

### Meta Stories/Reels (9:16)
**Goal:** Native content feeling

- **Dominant trigger:** Processing fluency (must look like user content)
- **Support triggers:** Urgency + emotional resonance
- **Format:** Platform-native text styles, not burned-in professional

### TikTok (9:16)
**Goal:** Pattern interrupt without ad signal

- **Dominant trigger:** Processing fluency + social proof
- **Support triggers:** Emotional core
- **Critical:** "Ugly" aesthetic mandatory — polish = death

### Landing Page Hero
**Goal:** Build trust, continue momentum

- **Dominant trigger:** Authority/trust signaling
- **Support triggers:** Emotional resonance + social proof
- **Resolution:** 2K minimum for quality signal

## AI Limitation Workarounds

### Text in Images
AI generates garbled text. Work around it:

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Documents | Show at distance, angle, or heavy blur |
| Phone screens | Angle screen away, show reaction to screen |
| Signs/headlines | Overlay in post, or imply without showing |
| Legal papers | Person holding, focused on expression not text |

### Hands & Fingers
AI struggles with complex hand positions.

| Solution | Execution |
|----------|-----------|
| Simple poses | Hands folded, resting, single gesture |
| Partial visibility | Hands partially out of frame |
| Object interaction | Holding phone, document, coffee cup |

### Multiple People
Complex positioning issues.

| Solution | Execution |
|----------|-----------|
| 1-2 people max | Primary subject with implied others |
| Separated positioning | People not touching/interacting closely |
| Background presence | Others blurred, out of focus |

## The Kill List: What Never Works

### Psychological Kills
| Imagery | Why It Fails | Trigger Blocked |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Stock photo aesthetic | "I've seen this 1000 times" — filters as ad | Processing fluency |
| Model-perfect faces | Triggers "someone selling to me" defense | Mirror neuron |
| Posed, centered compositions | Screams "advertising" | Authenticity |
| Over-produced polish | Activates System 2 skepticism | Trust signals |
| Corporate coldness | Removes emotional connection | Emotional resonance |

### Compliance Kills
| Imagery | Why Rejected | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Blood, visible injuries | Sensational content policy | Recovery context |
| Crying/distressed at camera | Personal attributes exploitation | Resilience, hope framing |
| Crash footage | Moment of impact exploitation | Aftermath, empty scene |
| Settlement checks with amounts | Implies guaranteed results | Celebration without numbers |

### The Recovery Reframe
Every banned concept has a behavioral alternative:

| Banned (Trauma Chapter) | Alternative (Recovery Chapter) | Same Emotion? |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| Crash moment | Empty intersection, aftermath | YES + forward motion |
| Hospital distress | Recovery at home, PT session | YES + hope layer |
| Victim suffering | Empowered client taking action | YES + agency |
| Graphic injury | Cast with signatures, healing | YES + community |

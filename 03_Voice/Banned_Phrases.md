## Instant Rejection Phrases

| ❌ BANNED PHRASE | WHY | ✅ USE INSTEAD |
|------------------|-----|----------------|
| "Are you injured?" | Personal attribute — implies you know something about them | "Accident victims may be entitled to compensation" |
| "Were you hurt?" | Personal attribute | "Those injured in accidents may have legal options" |
| "Were you in a crash?" | Personal attribute | "Car accident cases are being accepted" |
| "You deserve compensation" | Guarantee + personal attribute (double whammy) | "Compensation may be available for qualifying cases" |
| "You could get $$$" | Promise/guarantee | "Settlements in similar cases have reached $X" |
| "You may be owed money" | Personal attribute + guarantee | "Compensation may be available for qualifying cases" |
| "Hurt at work?" | Personal attribute | "Workplace injury claims are on the rise" |
| "Call now before it's too late" | False urgency — Meta thinks you're scamming | "Statutes of limitations apply to all cases" |
| "Don't wait!" | False urgency | "Time limits may affect legal options" |
| "100% free" | Nothing is 100% free — they know it | "No upfront cost to speak with an attorney" |
| "Exposed to [toxic substance]?" | Personal health attribute | "Individuals exposed to [substance] may have legal options" |
| "Were you diagnosed with...?" | Personal health attribute | "Those diagnosed with [condition] may have legal options" |

## Guarantee Language (Banned)

| ❌ BANNED | WHY |
|-----------|-----|
| "Get $100,000+" | Promise of specific outcome |
| "Guaranteed settlement" | No outcome can be guaranteed |
| "You WILL receive..." | Promise |
| "We'll get you paid" | Promise |
| "Maximum compensation guaranteed" | Double guarantee |

> **Saul says:** "'Get $100,000+' is a promise. Promises get you banned AND sued. 'Settlements in similar cases have ranged from $X to $Y depending on case specifics.' That's a fact. Facts are bulletproof."

## Urgency Language (Banned or Risky)

| ❌ BANNED/RISKY | ✅ COMPLIANT ALTERNATIVE |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| "Call NOW!" | "Connect with an attorney" |
| "Don't wait!" | "Statutes of limitations apply" |
| "Before it's too late!" | "Time limits may affect legal options" |
| "Limited time!" | "Legal deadlines vary by state" |
| "Act fast!" | "Learn about your legal options" |
| "Last chance!" | [Remove — no compliant equivalent] |

---

## Exploitative Language (Banned)

| ❌ BANNED | WHY |
|-----------|-----|
| "We know you're suffering" | Exploitative + personal attribute |
| "In pain?" | Personal attribute |
| "Struggling after your accident?" | Personal attribute |
| "We fight for victims like you" | "Like you" = personal attribute |
| "Don't be a victim twice" | Exploitative |

---

## Recommendation Language (Banned for Lead Gen)

| ❌ BANNED | WHY |
|-----------|-----|
| "We recommend the best attorneys" | Lead gen cannot "recommend" — that's referral service territory |
| "The best lawyers for your case" | Same issue |
| "We'll match you with the perfect firm" | "Perfect" = guarantee |

**We are a lead aggregator, not a referral service.** We connect, we don't recommend.

✅ Use instead: "Connect with experienced attorneys"

## Pattern Recognition

Before approving copy, check for these patterns:

1. **"You" + injury/pain/condition** → REJECT
2. **"You" + deserve/owed/entitled** → REJECT
3. **Any specific dollar guarantee** → REJECT (unless qualified with "similar cases have...")
4. **Urgency without legal basis** → REJECT
5. **"Recommend" or "best"** → REJECT
6. **Health condition questions** → REJECT

## Saul's Final Word

> **Saul says:** "See the pattern? Remove 'you.' Add qualifiers. Turn accusations into observations. It's lawyer-speak, yes. But it's lawyer-speak that keeps the lights on."

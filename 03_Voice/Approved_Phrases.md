## CREATIVE ADVANTAGE PHRASES (Use These First — B2B Only)

> These are Second Chair's ownable, competitor-proof positioning phrases. Lead with these in all B2B (attorney-facing) communications.

**How to think about "The Creative Advantage":**
The Creative Advantage is Second Chair's core differentiator. Most legal lead gen runs the same generic ads through the same playbook. Second Chair wins because the creative itself performs better — better ads attract higher-intent claimants, better funnels screen out the noise, and better strategy means the leads that reach your intake team are worth your time. The creative is the mechanism. Do NOT reduce this to "we make pretty ads" — the creative advantage is end-to-end: strategy, targeting, ad creative, funnel design, and qualification.

**Two axes, never conflate them:**
- *What* Second Chair delivers: the full case spectrum (soft tissue through catastrophic)
- *How* Second Chair delivers it: superior creative strategy (better ads, better funnels, better targeting — the creative advantage)

- **"The Creative Advantage"** — the primary positioning phrase
- **"Better Creative. Better Cases."** — the shorthand
- "We don't send you leads. We send you cases."
- "Most lead gen companies deliver a phone number. We deliver a case — pre-screened, pre-qualified, and ready for intake."
- "Pre-screened, pre-qualified, ready for intake."
- "The industry sends names. We send cases."
- "We hold every lead — soft tissue to wrongful death — to the same standard."
- "We're not padding your volume with slop. Everything that reaches your intake team is worth your time."
- "Better ads attract real intent. Better funnels screen out the noise. That's the creative advantage."
- "Your leads are only as good as the creative that attracted them."
- "Same playbook, same results. We run a different playbook."

# Third-Person Rules (The "YOU" Ban)

## Why "YOU" Gets Banned

Meta Advertising Standards Chapter 4 (Personal Attributes):
- Cannot assert or imply personal attributes
- "Are YOU injured?" = BANNED (implies you know something about them)
- "Were YOU in a crash?" = BANNED (personal attribute)
- It's the fastest way to get an ad rejected or account restricted

> **Saul says:** "Here's the golden rule, and I need you to tattoo this somewhere: the word 'YOU' is radioactive. 'Are YOU injured?' Banned. 'Were YOU in a crash?' Banned. It's called 'Personal Attributes' and Meta treats it like kryptonite."

## The Fix: Third-Person Language

Instead of addressing the user directly about their condition, speak about "people" or "victims" in general.

| ❌ BANNED (Second Person) | ✅ APPROVED (Third Person) |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| "Are you injured?" | "Accident victims may be entitled to compensation" |
| "Were you in a crash?" | "Car accident cases are being accepted" |
| "Were you hurt at work?" | "Workplace injury claims are on the rise" |
| "You could get $$$" | "Settlements in similar cases have reached $X" |
| "You may be owed money" | "Compensation may be available for qualifying cases" |
| "Don't wait!" | "Statutes of limitations apply to all cases" |
| "Were you exposed to [substance]?" | "Individuals exposed to [substance] may have legal options" |

---

## The Psychology Behind It

> **Saul says:** "It's like the difference between 'Did you commit a crime?' and 'If someone has committed a crime...' One's an accusation, one's a hypothetical. We live in hypotheticals now."

**Second person** = "I know something about you" = Personal Attribute = Ban

**Third person** = "This exists in the world" = Observation = Safe

|-----------|-------------|
| "Hurt in a Car Crash?" | "Car Accident Cases Being Accepted" |
| "Injured on the Job?" | "Workplace Injury Claims on the Rise" |
| "Were You Diagnosed with Cancer?" | "Individuals Diagnosed with Cancer May Have Legal Options" |
| "Did You Fall at a Store?" | "Slip and Fall Cases Under Review" |

## When "You" IS Okay

"You" can be used in contexts that don't assert personal attributes about injury/condition:

✅ OK:
- "You can call anytime" (process, not condition)
- "Connect with an attorney who can help you" (help, not injury)
- "Get the information you need" (neutral)

❌ NOT OK:
- "Were you injured?" (condition)
- "You deserve compensation" (attribute + guarantee)
- "If you were hurt..." (condition)

---

## Quick Check

Before approving any copy, scan for:
1. "You" + injury/pain/condition → REJECT
2. "You" + deserve/owed/entitled → REJECT  
3. "You" + were/are + [medical condition] → REJECT
4. "You" + neutral action (call, learn, connect) → OK

## The Empathy-First Framework

> **Source:** Robert Collier + Patrick Slaughter — Third-person copy can still be deeply empathetic. The key is to "enter the conversation in their mind" without triggering personal attribute flags.

### The 3-Part Empathy Structure (Third Person)

**1. Acknowledge their situation (third person)**
> "Accident victims often feel overwhelmed by medical bills and insurance calls."

**2. Validate their feelings (third person)**
> "It's natural to feel frustrated when someone else's mistake changed your life."

**3. Offer hope (third person)**
> "Compensation may be available for those who qualify."

### Empathy + Compliance Examples

| ❌ Second Person (Banned) | ✅ Third Person + Empathy (Approved) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| "Are you overwhelmed after your accident?" | "Accident victims often feel overwhelmed. They don't have to face it alone." |
| "You deserve better than this." | "Those injured through no fault of their own deserve answers." |
| "We know you're hurting." | "Recovery is hard. We help lighten the burden." |
| "Don't let them take advantage of you." | "Insurance companies often try to settle for less than cases are worth." |

### The "Enter the Conversation" Technique

> **From Collier:** "Always enter the conversation already taking place in the customer's mind."

**What the victim is thinking at each stage:**

| Stage | Their Mental Conversation | Third-Person Copy That Joins It |
|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Shock | "What do I do now?" | "After an accident, the first 48 hours matter most. Here's what to know." |
| Anger | "This wasn't my fault." | "When someone else's negligence causes harm, there are legal options." |
| Overwhelm | "I can't handle one more thing." | "We handle the insurance companies. Accident victims focus on healing." |
| Decision | "Who can I trust?" | "500+ families have trusted us with their cases. Here are their stories." |

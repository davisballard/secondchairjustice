# 1. LOSS AVERSION COPY

**Core Principle:** People feel losses 2x more intensely than equivalent gains. Frame around what they'll LOSE, not what they'll gain.

**Key Studies:** Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), Regret Aversion (Loomes & Sugden, 1982)

## Word Substitution Matrix

| ❌ Weak (Gain Frame) | ✅ Strong (Loss Frame) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| "You could get money" | "Don't leave money on the table" |
| "Get compensated" | "Stop losing money every day you wait" |
| "Free consultation" | "See what you're owed" |
| "We can help" | "Don't let them underpay you" |
| "Get what you deserve" | "Don't settle for their first offer" |

## Hook Formulas

```
❌ "You could receive compensation..."
✅ "You're losing money every day you don't [action]..."

❌ "Get a free case review..."
✅ "Stop leaving [$X] on the table..."

❌ "Lawyers can help you..."
✅ "Insurance companies are trained to underpay you..."
```

## MVA Examples

- "After a crash, most people accept offers 10x less than their case is worth."
- "Every day you wait, evidence disappears and your case gets weaker."
- "Insurance adjusters are trained to get you to accept less. Here's what they don't want you to know..."
- "Don't let a car accident cost you twice — once in injuries, again in lost compensation."

---

# 2. SCARCITY & URGENCY COPY

**Core Principle:** Limited time/quantity increases perceived value and triggers immediate action.

**Key Studies:** Worchel Cookie Jar (1975), Cialdini Scarcity Principle (1984)

## Word Substitution Matrix

| ❌ Weak (Passive) | ✅ Strong (Scarcity) |
|------------------|----------------------|
| "Contact us anytime" | "Time limits apply to your case" |
| "We're here when you're ready" | "Your deadline is approaching" |
| "Learn more" | "Check before it's too late" |
| "Available for review" | "Limited review windows" |

## Hook Formulas

```
❌ "Call us for a consultation..."
✅ "Your statute of limitations may be closer than you think..."

❌ "We review cases..."
✅ "Only [X] days remain to file in your state..."

❌ "Talk to a lawyer..."
✅ "Before you miss your deadline..."
```

## Urgency Qualifiers (Compliance-Safe)

- "Statutes of limitations apply to all cases"
- "Time limits may affect your legal options"
- "Legal deadlines vary by case type and state"
- "Evidence degrades over time — early review is critical"

## MVA Examples

- "Security footage is often erased after 30 days. Have you preserved your evidence?"
- "California gives you 2 years — but the clock started when the accident happened."
- "Witnesses forget. Evidence disappears. The insurance company is counting on you to wait."

---

# 3. SOCIAL PROOF COPY

**Core Principle:** People follow what others do, especially similar others. Local/specific proof > generic statistics.

**Key Studies:** Asch Conformity (1951), Cialdini Hotel Towel Study (2008)

## Word Substitution Matrix

| ❌ Weak (Generic) | ✅ Strong (Specific Social Proof) |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| "We help many people" | "2,847 [City] residents reviewed their cases this month" |
| "People trust us" | "Join thousands who got more than the first offer" |
| "We have experience" | "95% of accident victims don't know this one thing..." |

## Hook Formulas

```
❌ "We help accident victims..."
✅ "Join thousands of [City] drivers who discovered what their case was really worth..."

❌ "Contact a lawyer..."
✅ "Accident victims are sharing this before it gets taken down..."

❌ "Free consultation..."
✅ "This is what [City] drivers are doing after their accidents..."
```

## MVA Examples

- "✓ 2,847 California drivers reviewed their cases this month"
- "You're not alone — thousands of accident victims had no idea they were being underpaid."
- "9 out of 10 accident victims accept the first offer. The 10th? They discover what their case is really worth."

---

# 4. AUTHORITY COPY

**Core Principle:** People defer to experts and institutions. Credentials, titles, and insider knowledge trigger trust.

**Key Studies:** Milgram Obedience (1963), Hovland & Weiss Source Credibility (1951)

## Word Substitution Matrix

| ❌ Weak (Generic) | ✅ Strong (Authority) |
|------------------|----------------------|
| "Lawyers say" | "Insurance defense attorneys admit" |
| "We know" | "Industry insiders reveal" |
| "Contact us" | "Experienced attorneys handling MVA cases" |
| "We can help" | "Board-certified personal injury specialists" |

## Hook Formulas

```
❌ "A lawyer can help you..."
✅ "I'm a lawyer and here are 3 things I would NEVER do after a crash..."

❌ "We have experience..."
✅ "Insurance adjusters are trained to say this. Here's what they don't tell you..."

❌ "Learn about your rights..."
✅ "What defense lawyers don't want you to know about your accident case..."
```

## The "Insider" Voice

Use language that positions the speaker as having access to hidden knowledge:
- "I'm a lawyer and I would NEVER..."
- "Insurance companies train their adjusters to..."
- "What they don't want you to know..."
- "The one thing they're hoping you don't find out..."

## MVA Examples

- "I'm a personal injury attorney. Here's exactly what insurance companies are hoping you don't know about your car accident case."
- "Insurance defense attorneys admitted this strategy in court — and it's probably being used on your claim right now."

---

# 5. COGNITIVE EASE COPY

**Core Principle:** Simple, fluent language feels more true and trustworthy. Complex = suspicious.

**Key Studies:** Processing Fluency (Reber et al., 1998), Oppenheimer's Simplicity Study (2006)

## Word Substitution Matrix

| ❌ Complex | ✅ Simple |
|-----------|----------|
| "Initiate a consultation" | "Talk to a lawyer" |
| "Determine your eligibility" | "See if you qualify" |
| "Pursue legal remedies" | "Get what you're owed" |
| "Compensation entitlements" | "Money you deserve" |
| "File a personal injury claim" | "Start your case" |

## Hook Formulas

```
❌ "Determine if you may be entitled to financial compensation..."
✅ "See what your accident case is really worth..."

❌ "Initiate a comprehensive case evaluation..."
✅ "Find out in 2 minutes..."

❌ "Our experienced legal professionals will assess..."
✅ "A lawyer will review your case — free..."
```

## Sentence Structure Rules

- Max 15 words per sentence in hooks
- Use active voice: "Insurance companies underpay" not "Settlements are often reduced"
- Conversational tone: Write how people speak
- One idea per sentence

## MVA Examples

- "Hurt in a wreck? See what you're owed."
- "Car accident? 2-minute check. Free."
- "They offered you $2,500. Your case could be worth $150,000."

---

# 6. CURIOSITY GAP COPY

**Core Principle:** Incomplete information creates mental tension that the brain wants to resolve. Open the loop, then offer resolution.

**Key Studies:** Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory (1994), Zeigarnik Effect (1927)

## Word Substitution Matrix

| ❌ Complete Information | ✅ Curiosity Gap |
|------------------------|------------------|
| "Here's what your case is worth" | "See what your case is REALLY worth" |
| "Insurance companies underpay" | "What insurance companies don't want you to know" |
| "You might have a case" | "This one detail could change everything" |

## Hook Formulas

```
❌ "Insurance companies often underpay accident victims..."
✅ "I literally cannot believe insurance adjusters get away with this..."

❌ "You may be entitled to compensation..."
✅ "There's one thing insurance companies are hoping you never find out..."

❌ "Get a free case review..."
✅ "This is what insurance adjusters are trained to say — and why it's costing you thousands..."
```

## Open Loop Techniques

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **The Reveal** | "Here's what they don't want you to know..." |
| **The Secret** | "The one thing that changes everything..." |
| **The Mistake** | "Most accident victims make this mistake..." |
| **The Number** | "This one number could cost you thousands..." |
| **The Incredulous** | "I can't believe they told my client THIS..." |

## MVA Examples

- "What happens to your case after 30 days might shock you..."
- "There's a reason insurance adjusters call you within 48 hours. And it's not to help you."
- "This one sentence could be the difference between $5,000 and $150,000."

---

# 7. ANCHORING COPY

**Core Principle:** First numbers set expectations. Show the gap between low anchor and high anchor to create perceived loss.

**Key Studies:** Tversky & Kahneman Anchoring (1974), Ariely's Arbitrary Coherence (2003)

## Number Framing Rules

1. **Lead with the low anchor** (what they're being offered)
2. **Follow with the high anchor** (what cases like theirs settle for)
3. **Make the gap visceral** (show the loss)

## Hook Formulas

```
❌ "Get a fair settlement..."
✅ "They offered $2,500. Cases like yours settle for $85,000 - $150,000."

❌ "You deserve compensation..."
✅ "The average first offer is 10x less than the case is worth."

❌ "Don't settle for less..."
✅ "$2,500 offered → $150,000 recovered. What's your gap?"
```

## Specificity Matters

| ❌ Round Numbers | ✅ Specific Numbers |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| "About $100,000" | "$97,500" |
| "Roughly 2 months" | "47 days" |
| "Around 90%" | "91.3%" |

Specific numbers = credibility. Round numbers = made up.

## MVA Examples

- "Insurance's first offer: $3,200. After legal review: $127,500. What's your gap?"
- "The average unrepresented accident victim recovers $7,500. With representation: $85,000+."
- "That 'fair offer' they're pushing? It's typically 8-10x less than what cases settle for."

---

# 8. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY COPY

**Core Principle:** Once people take small actions, they're more likely to take larger consistent actions. Start small, escalate gradually.

**Key Studies:** Foot-in-the-Door (Freedman & Fraser, 1966), Sunk Cost (Arkes & Blumer, 1985)

## Quiz Funnel Progression

| Stage | Commitment Level | Example Copy |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Q1 (Entry)** | Micro | "Were you in an accident in the last 2 years?" |
| **Q2** | Small | "Were there injuries?" |
| **Q3** | Medium | "Have you spoken with insurance?" |
| **Q4** | Invested | "What's your zip code?" |
| **Lead Capture** | Earned | "We found options for you. Enter your info to see results." |

## Pre-Commitment Language

```
❌ "Give us your information..."
✅ "You've started — now see your results..."

❌ "Enter your phone number..."
✅ "Almost done! Where should we send your report?"

❌ "Complete this form..."
✅ "Step 3 of 4: Just a few more details..."
```

## Investment Acknowledgment

After quiz completion, acknowledge their investment:
- "Based on what you've told us..."
- "Your answers indicate..."
- "You've already started — here's what's next..."

## MVA Examples

- "Step 1: Take the 60-second quiz. Step 2: See your estimate."
- "80% complete — you're almost there."
- "You've answered 4 questions. Let's see what your case could be worth."

---

# 9. EMOTION & AFFECT COPY

**Core Principle:** Emotions drive decisions. Match emotional state, then guide toward action. Specific emotions trigger specific behaviors.

**Key Studies:** Affect Heuristic (Slovic et al., 2002), Mood-as-Information (Schwarz & Clore, 1983)

## Emotional Tone Progression

| Stage | Emotion to Activate | Copy Approach |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Hook** | Anger, frustration, fear | "Insurance companies are counting on you to give up..." |
| **Education** | Validation, understanding | "It's not your fault they're trained to underpay you..." |
| **Solution** | Hope, relief | "There's another way. And it starts with a 2-minute check..." |
| **CTA** | Empowerment | "Take control of your case." |

## Emotion-Specific Language

**Fear/Urgency:**
- "Before it's too late..."
- "Your deadline is approaching..."
- "Evidence disappears every day..."

**Anger (Villain Framing):**
- "Insurance companies are trained to..."
- "They're counting on you to accept less..."
- "What they don't want you to know..."

**Hope/Relief:**
- "You don't have to fight alone..."
- "There's still time..."
- "Thousands have recovered what they're owed..."

**Validation:**
- "If you're feeling overwhelmed, you're not alone..."
- "Most accident victims have no idea..."
- "It's not your fault they made it confusing..."

## MVA Examples

- "Frustrated with insurance? You're not alone. Here's what they're hoping you don't know..."
- "You shouldn't have to fight for what's yours. Let's see if you qualify for help."
- "The stress after an accident is real. So is leaving money on the table."

---

# 10. IDENTITY COPY

**Core Principle:** People are motivated to act consistently with who they are (or want to be). Frame actions as expressions of identity.

**Key Studies:** Self-Perception Theory (Bem, 1972), Possible Selves (Oyserman, 2007)

## Identity Framing

| ❌ Action Frame | ✅ Identity Frame |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "Get a consultation" | "Smart drivers don't accept the first offer" |
| "Contact a lawyer" | "Informed accident victims know this trick" |
| "Review your case" | "People who get fair settlements do this first" |

## "People Like You" Language

```
❌ "Accident victims can..."
✅ "California drivers like you are discovering..."

❌ "You should..."
✅ "Smart accident victims know..."

❌ "Get help..."
✅ "People who refuse to be underpaid do this..."
```

## Regional Identity Markers

- "[City] drivers" — Local belonging
- "[State] residents" — State-specific laws
- "Commuters on [Highway]" — Hyper-local relevance

## MVA Examples

- "Savvy Seattle drivers aren't accepting the first offer. Here's why."
- "California drivers: This law change affects your accident case."
- "If you were hurt on the 405, this is for you."

---

# 11. TRUST & CREDIBILITY COPY

**Core Principle:** Trust reduces perceived risk. Clear signals of safety, transparency, and credentials increase conversion.

**Key Studies:** Fogg's Web Credibility (2003), McKnight's Initial Trust Formation (2002)

## Trust Signals (Copy)

| Signal Type | Copy Element |
|-------------|--------------|
| **No Risk** | "Free. No obligation. No commitment." |
| **Transparency** | "Here's exactly what happens next..." |
| **Credentials** | "Board-certified attorneys" |
| **Process Clarity** | "Step 1: Answer 4 questions. Step 2: Get your estimate." |
| **Social Proof** | "Join 10,000+ who've checked their case value" |

## Trust-Building Phrases

- "No cost. No obligation. No pressure."
- "Your information is secure and confidential."
- "Speak with a real attorney — not a call center."
- "If you don't have a case, we'll tell you. That's it."

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Trust-Building Response |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| "Is this legit?" | "Licensed attorneys in your state review every case." |
| "Will I get spammed?" | "One call. That's it. No spam, no sales." |
| "What does it cost?" | "Free. Attorneys only get paid if you win." |

## MVA Examples

- "Free case check. No obligation. 2 minutes."
- "Confidential. Secure. No commitment required."
- "Real attorneys — not call centers. Real answers — not sales pitches."

---

# 12. TIME & DELAY COPY

**Core Principle:** People prefer immediate rewards. Frame benefits as happening NOW, not in the abstract future.

**Key Studies:** Hyperbolic Discounting (Laibson, 1997), Construal Level Theory (Trope & Liberman, 2003)

## Immediacy Framing

| ❌ Delayed | ✅ Immediate |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Eventually get compensated" | "See your estimate in 2 minutes" |
| "A lawyer will contact you" | "Get answers now" |
| "We'll review your case" | "Instant case check" |

## Time Compression

| ❌ Long Duration Feel | ✅ Short Duration Feel |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| "1 month" | "30 days" |
| "A few minutes" | "60 seconds" |
| "Soon" | "In 2 minutes" |

## Present-Tense Action

```
❌ "You could receive..."
✅ "See what you're owed..."

❌ "A lawyer may be able to..."
✅ "Find out now..."

❌ "You might qualify..."
✅ "Check if you qualify — 60 seconds..."
```

## MVA Examples

- "See your case estimate in 60 seconds. Free."
- "Find out what you're owed — now."
- "2-minute quiz. Instant results. No waiting."

# QUIZ FUNNEL COPY BY STAGE

## Stage 1: Opening (Low Commitment)

**Formula:** Simple yes/no or binary choice.

**Examples:**
- "Were you in a car accident in the last 2 years?"
- "Did the accident happen in California?"
- "Were there any injuries?"

## Stage 2: Qualification (Building Investment)

**Purpose:** Increase commitment through answering. Each question = more investment.

**Formula:** Progressive specificity.

**Examples:**
- "How long ago did the accident happen?"
- "Have you already spoken with insurance?"
- "What type of accident was it? (Car / Motorcycle / Truck / Rideshare)"

## Stage 3: Loading Screen (Anticipation)

**Purpose:** Create anticipation + loss aversion. They've invested; now they want results.

**Formula:** Show processing + tease value.

**Examples:**
- "Calculating your potential case value..."
- "Checking statutes of limitations in your state..."
- "Matching you with qualified attorneys..."

## Stage 4: Lead Capture (Earned Reward)

**Purpose:** Frame info capture as accessing earned results, not giving information.

**Formula:** "You've earned this — here's how to get it."

**Examples:**
- "Your results are ready. Where should we send them?"
- "Good news: You may have a case. Enter your info to connect with an attorney."
- "We found options for you. Last step: confirm your details."

Most legal lead gen looks the same because it is the same. Same stock creative. Same generic funnels. Same race to the bottom on cost per lead. The attorneys we work with are done settling for that.

Second Chair is exclusive legal lead generation for PI law firms — built on a simple premise: your leads are only as good as the creative that attracted them. We call it the Creative Advantage. Better ads attract higher-intent claimants. Better funnels screen out the noise before intake ever gets involved. Better strategy means the leads that reach your phone are worth your time — across the full case spectrum, from soft tissue that keeps the lights on to catastrophic cases that change a firm's trajectory.

What does that look like in practice?

Creative strategy built by people who understand both performance marketing and the PI buyer journey. Campaigns that don't just generate volume — they generate the right volume. Ad creative, funnel design, and qualification systems that work together so your intake team spends time on real conversations, not dead leads.

What it means for a partner firm: soft tissue volume you can count on, intentional targeting for the high-value cases that build the practice, and a creative standard that compounds over time — because better creative doesn't just perform once, it keeps performing.

One firm per market. No exceptions.

**Who we work with:** Personal injury firms — MVA, rideshare, commercial trucking, TBI, wrongful death.

## Notes for Execution

- "The Creative Advantage" is always capitalized — it's a proper positioning phrase, not a generic descriptor
- "Better Creative. Better Cases." is the shorthand — use when space is limited
- The About copy positions creative quality as the differentiator across the full case spectrum, not just high-value cases
- "One firm per market" is a standalone line. The period and line break are intentional — Ed's rhythm.
- Do not add buzzwords like "game-changing," "revolutionary," or "cutting-edge"
- Three co-founders: Davis Ballard (Marketing & Creative), Alex DuBelko (Product & Innovation), Sasha Zinshtein (Growth)

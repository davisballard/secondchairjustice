## 5. WASHINGTON-SPECIFIC NOTES

### Market Context

- **Primary Target:** Seattle metro area (King County)
- **Secondary:** Tacoma, Bellevue, Spokane
- **Visual Localization:** Seattle skyline, Space Needle, Pacific Northwest greenery, I-5 corridor

### Copy Localization

- "Seattle accident" / "Washington crash"
- "Washington injury claims"
- "Puget Sound area accidents"
- Reference Washington statute of limitations (3 years for PI)

### Enforcement

- WSBA has medium enforcement activity
- Complaint-driven investigations
- Professional, but not aggressive
- Focus on consumer protection, not technical violations

### Cultural Notes

## Overview

Different states have different Bar advertising rules. Key variations:
- Disclosure requirements
- "Specialist" language restrictions
- Dramatization labeling
- Fee structure disclosures

---

## California (Rules 7.1-7.5) ⚠️ SB37 LEGISLATION

### Key Rules
- **7.1:** No false or misleading statements
- **7.2:** No guarantees of outcomes
- **7.3:** Specific disclosure requirements
- **7.5:** Dramatizations must be labeled

### ⚠️ SB37 Legislation — Critical Compliance

**SB37 has fundamentally changed the tone of voice for accident victim outreach in California.**

| Restriction | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| ❌ Crash footage | Cannot use actual or simulated crash footage |
| ❌ Promise amounts | Cannot promise specific settlement amounts |
| ❌ "Get more" framing | Cannot imply client already settled and is getting more |
| ✅ Trusted advisor tone | Must position as helpful resource, not ambulance-chaser |
| ✅ Footer disclosure | Must include Jacoby & Meyers disclosure on all funnels |

**The Tone Shift:**
> California wants you to be the "trusted advisor" — not someone dramatizing accidents to drive fear and urgency. This affects ALL creative for this state.

### Required Disclosures
- [ ] Standard Second Chair disclosures
- [ ] "This is a dramatization" (if using actors/scenarios)
- [ ] Jacoby & Meyers CYA footer language

### Restrictions
- Cannot claim "specialist" or "expert" without certification
- No guarantee language
- No false/misleading statements
- **Cannot use crash footage** (SB37)
- **Cannot promise settlement amounts** (SB37)

### Notes
California requires more careful creative review than other states. The SB37 legislation is actively enforced. When in doubt, consult @Saul.

## LRS vs Lead Gen Distinction

**Critical:** We are a **lead generator**, NOT a **lawyer referral service (LRS)**.

| Lawyer Referral Service | Lead Generator (Us) |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Regulated by State Bar | Less regulated |
| Can "recommend" attorneys | Cannot "recommend" |
| Different disclosure rules | Lead gen disclosures |
| May require registration | No Bar registration |

**Our language:** "Connect with" — never "recommend" or "match with best"

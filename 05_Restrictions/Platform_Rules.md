# Platform Rules: Second Chair

> **Source:** Saul.md Sections 2.1, 6.4, and Quick Reference

---

## Meta (Facebook/Instagram)

### Special Ad Categories — MANDATORY

Second Chair ads fall under **Special Ad Categories** because we advertise legal services.

**You MUST select:** Special Ad Category when creating campaigns

**Restrictions that apply:**
- ❌ No detailed interest targeting
- ❌ No Lookalike audiences (based on injury data)
- ❌ No age targeting (beyond 18+)
- ❌ No gender targeting
- ❌ No custom audiences from health signals
- ✅ **State and zip code targeting IS ALLOWED** — can target CA, specific zip codes in all states
- ✅ Age 18+ allowed
- ✅ Language targeting allowed

> **CLARIFICATION (Jan 2026):** Geographic targeting (state + zip codes) is fully available in Special Ad Categories. The restriction is on demographics, interests, and lookalikes — NOT on location.

> **Saul says:** "I know it feels like fighting with one hand tied behind your back. Welcome to legal advertising."

### Personal Attributes Policy (Chapter 4)

**THE RULE:** Cannot assert or imply personal attributes about the viewer.

| ❌ BANNED | ✅ ALLOWED |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Are YOU injured?" | "Accident victims may be entitled..." |
| "Were YOU in a crash?" | "Car accident cases being accepted" |
| Any "you" + injury/condition | Third-person observations |

---

### Sensational Content Policy (Chapter 13)

**THE RULE:** No gore, graphic injuries, or exploitative distress.

| ❌ BANNED | ✅ ALLOWED |
|-----------|-----------|
| Blood, visible injuries | Recovery imagery (cast, crutches) |
| Crash footage with victims | Abstract legal symbols (gavel, scales) |
| Crying/distressed faces | Confident, hopeful expressions |
| Trauma moments | Aftermath/recovery moments |

---

### Meta Approval Tips

1. **Third-person language only** — avoid "you" + injury
2. **Hope over trauma** — show recovery, not accidents
3. **Clear disclosures** — "This is an advertisement"
4. **Monitor CPMs** — spikes = algorithm flagging you
5. **Don't rapid-resubmit** — wait 24 hours after rejection

---

## Google Ads

### Legal Services Policy

**Requirements:**
- Must comply with local licensing requirements
- No guarantees of outcomes
- Cannot misrepresent who you are

**Lead Gen Specific:**
- We are NOT a law firm — disclose clearly
- Cannot claim to be attorneys
- Must clarify we connect users with firms

---

### Personalized Advertising Policy

Similar to Meta's Personal Attributes:
- Cannot target based on health conditions
- Cannot imply knowledge of user's injury

---

### Healthcare & Medicines Filter

**Warning:** Injury imagery can trigger this filter even for legal ads.

- Avoid medical imagery
- Avoid injury close-ups
- Stick to abstract legal symbols

---

### Google Approval Tips

1. **Clear identity** — We are Second Chair (lead gen), not a law firm
2. **No misrepresentation** — Don't imply we're attorneys
3. **Qualified claims only** — "Settlements in similar cases..."
4. **Avoid medical triggers** — No injury imagery

---

## YouTube (via Google)

### Content Policy

- Same rules as Google Display
- No shocking/sensational content
- No graphic injury footage
- Keep it professional

---

## TikTok

### Legal Services — HEAVILY RESTRICTED

> **Saul says:** "TikTok? Don't even get me started. Legal services are heavily restricted."

- Limited inventory for legal ads
- Strict content review
- May not be viable for Second Chair currently
- Test cautiously if at all

---

## LinkedIn

### Legal Advertising

- Actually "pretty chill for legal" per Saul
- BUT: Audience is attorneys, not plaintiffs
- Not a primary platform for PI lead gen
- Could be useful for B2B (attorney outreach)

---

## Cross-Platform Quick Reference

| Platform | Primary Risk | Watch For |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Meta** | Personal Attributes | "You" + injury, health signals |
| **Google** | Misrepresentation | Fake law firm identity, unverified claims |
| **YouTube** | Shocking Content | Gore, distress, sensationalism |
| **TikTok** | Heavy Restrictions | May not be viable |
| **All** | TCPA 2025 | Consent language, named entities |

---

## Account Health

### Warning Signs
- Rising CPMs without explanation
- Multiple rejections in 24 hours
- Sudden reach drops
- Review pending for extended time

### If Account Gets Flagged

1. **Stop everything** — Kill all running ads immediately
2. **Cool down** — 48-72 hours
3. **Audit** — Review all creatives against blacklist
4. **Go green** — Restart with safe creatives only
5. **Rebuild trust** — Conservative approach before testing limits

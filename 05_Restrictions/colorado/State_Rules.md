## 7. SAUL'S COLORADO SUMMARY

> **Saul:** "Colorado's your middle-of-the-road state. More room than California, less than Nevada.
>
> **The play:**
> - Professional tone, but you can be direct
> - Settlement mentions with disclaimers — okay
> - Crash footage — use with caution
> - Fighter positioning — moderate, not extreme
>
> If Nevada's the green light and California's the yellow light, Colorado's the blinking yellow. Proceed, but look both ways."

# Second Chair — "Double Hurt" Campaign
> **Generated:** January 24, 2025
> **Status:** Ready for production
> **Concept:** "Don't get hurt by your insurance company"
> **Total:** 1 ad set (3 image variations) + 1 video script (3 clips)

---

## 🎯 Core Angle

**Strategic Insight:** Accident victims experience TWO injuries — the physical one and the financial/legal one that follows. Insurance companies and legal complexity become the second source of pain.

**Hook:** "Don't get hurt twice."

**Message Ladder:**
1. You got hurt in an accident
2. The insurance/legal process can hurt you again
3. We stop the second hurt before it starts

---

# AD SET: "THE DOUBLE HURT"

## Behavioral Trigger Stack

| Trigger | Mechanism | Application |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Loss Aversion** | "Don't lose" framing 2x more powerful than gain | "Don't get hurt again" |
| **Moral Framing** | Insurance as antagonist | Insurance company as the one "hurting" you |
| **Protection Motivation** | Threat + efficacy = action | Show threat, offer protection |
| **Self-Reference** | Personal relevance activates attention | "If you were hurt..." |

## Core Insight

The first hurt (the accident) already happened. The victim feels vulnerable. Now reframe the insurance process as a SECOND potential injury — one they can prevent by taking action now.

---

### Variation 1: The Shield — Clean

**Visual Format:** Person with documents looking overwhelmed, protective warmth nearby

**Ad Title:** Double Hurt - Shield Clean

**Post Copy:**
> Getting hurt in a car accident is painful enough.
>
> Don't let the insurance process hurt you again.
>
> Legal deadlines. Lowball offers. Denied claims. The system isn't designed to help you — it's designed to pay you less.
>
> We stop the second hurt before it starts.
>
> Free case review. No fees unless you win.
>
> This is an advertisement for legal services. Statutes of limitations apply.

**Headline:** Stop the Second Hurt

**Description:** Don't fight insurance alone. Free case review.

**CTA:** Get Protected Now

**Display Link:** claimjusticenow.com

**Strategy:** Loss aversion + Protection motivation — framing legal help as a shield against secondary injury

**Image Prompt:**
```
Middle-aged person at kitchen table surrounded by medical bills and insurance documents, tired but hopeful expression, warm morning light from window, family member's hand on their shoulder supportive, authentic messy table with coffee cup, documentary style, iPhone photo quality, NOT stock photo, natural imperfections, candid moment of finding hope, slight depth of field blur on documents
```

---

### Variation 2: The Warning — Split Frame

**Visual Format:** Split visual showing "before" (alone with insurance) vs "after" (protected)

**Ad Title:** Double Hurt - Warning Split

**Post Copy:**
> First, the accident hurt you.
>
> Then insurance tried to hurt you again.
>
> Their adjusters are trained to minimize your claim. Their lawyers protect their bottom line. Their deadlines work against you.
>
> Don't face them alone.
>
> See what your case is actually worth — before they convince you to accept less.
>
> Statutes of limitations apply to all cases.

**Headline:** Don't Get Hurt Twice

**Description:** See what others with similar cases received.

**CTA:** Check Your Case Value

**Display Link:** claimjusticenow.com

**Strategy:** Moral framing + Anchoring — insurance company as antagonist, expose their tactics

**Image Prompt:**
```
Split composition: left side shows isolated person holding insurance letter with concerned expression, cold blue-ish lighting, corporate building visible through window; right side shows same person with attorney figure reviewing documents together, warm golden lighting, partnership feeling, documentary photography style, iPhone quality, authentic facial expressions, NOT model-perfect faces, natural office setting
```

---

### Variation 3: The Fighter — POV Dashboard

**Visual Format:** POV from driver's perspective, aftermath of accident, resilience mood

**Ad Title:** Double Hurt - Fighter POV

**Post Copy:**
> The accident was just the beginning.
>
> Now comes the insurance company. The paperwork. The lowball offers. The waiting.
>
> They're counting on you to give up.
>
> We've helped thousands of drivers fight back — and win.
>
> Don't let them hurt you again. Find out what you're owed.
>
> This is an advertisement. Statutes of limitations apply.

**Headline:** Fight Back Against Insurance

**Description:** Free case review. We handle the insurance company.

**CTA:** Get Your Free Review

**Display Link:** claimjusticenow.com

**Strategy:** Self-reference + Defiance — POV activates self-reference, fighting framing empowers action

**Image Prompt:**
```
POV from driver seat looking through slightly cracked windshield, hands gripping steering wheel with determination, insurance paperwork visible on passenger seat, phone showing incoming call from unknown number, golden hour light streaming through window, empty intersection ahead symbolizing path forward, iPhone dashboard camera quality, raw authentic moment, NOT cinematic, slight motion blur, documentary style
```

# Compliance Checklist

✅ **Third-person language** — "Getting hurt" not "You got hurt"
✅ **Qualified claims** — "See what others with similar cases received"
✅ **Legal disclaimers** — "This is an advertisement. Statutes of limitations apply."
✅ **No promises** — No guaranteed amounts
✅ **No exploitative imagery** — Recovery/hope framing, no injury gore
✅ **Moral framing is factual** — Insurance tactics are documented reality

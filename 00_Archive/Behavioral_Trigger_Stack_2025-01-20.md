# AD 1: "THE GAP"

## Behavioral Trigger Stack
| Trigger | Mechanism | Application |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Loss Aversion** | Losses feel 2x more impactful than gains | Show money "left on table" |
| **Anchoring** | First numbers set expectations | Low offer → actual value gap |
| **Curiosity Gap** | Incomplete info creates tension | "What's YOUR gap?" |

## Core Insight
Most accident victims accept the first offer because they don't know any better. Show the visceral gap between insurance's low-ball and actual case values to activate loss aversion.

# AD 2: "THE COUNTDOWN"

## Behavioral Trigger Stack
| Trigger | Mechanism | Application |

✅ **No promises** — No guaranteed amounts, no "you will receive"
✅ **No exploitative imagery** — No blood, injury, distress

## Attorney Acquisition — Close Rate Scenarios

Partners are acquired through direct outreach: **10–25 firms targeted per DMA**.

### Outreach Model

**Baseline: 20 DMAs targeted/month × 15 firms per DMA = 300 reachouts/month**

Average close time: 2–4 weeks from first contact to signed partner.
Month 1 is pipeline building — first partners close in Month 2.

| Close Rate | New Partners/Month | After 6 Months | After 12 Months |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1% (conservative)** | 3 | 15 DMAs | 33 DMAs |
| **5% (moderate)** | 15 | 75 DMAs | 165 DMAs |
| **10% (strong)** | 30 | 150 DMAs | 210 DMAs (full market) |

### Close Rate Impact on DMA Fill

| Close Rate | Month 3 | Month 6 | Month 9 | Month 12 | Full Market (210 DMAs) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1%** | 6 DMAs (3%) | 15 DMAs (7%) | 24 DMAs (11%) | 33 DMAs (16%) | ~71 months |
| **5%** | 30 DMAs (14%) | 75 DMAs (36%) | 120 DMAs (57%) | 165 DMAs (79%) | ~15 months |
| **10%** | 60 DMAs (29%) | 150 DMAs (71%) | 210 DMAs (100%) | — | ~8 months |

## Combined Revenue Projections

All three streams combined. Per founder, 3 leads/day per DMA.

### Month 12 Combined (25% Premium Adoption, 20% Agency Services)

| Close Rate | DMAs | Lead-Gen Only | + Premium | + Agency Services | **COMBINED** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1%** | 33 | $2.97M/yr | +$2.88M | +$92K | **$5.95M/yr** |

### Revenue Stream Breakdown at Month 12, 1% Close (33 DMAs)

| Stream | Units | Per Founder Monthly | Per Founder Annual | % of Total |

## Key Insights & Strategic Priorities

### The Math

1. **$83–$108 per founder per lead.** That's the atomic unit. Everything else is multiplication.
2. **One DMA at 3 leads/day = $90K–$117K/year per founder.** One client, one market.
3. **11 DMAs (5% fill) crosses $1M/year per founder.** That's the first milestone.
4. **Even at 1% close on outreach, we add 3 DMAs/month.** Compounding with zero churn assumption.

### Strategic Priorities

1. **Dial in cost per lead** — Start at $150 target, optimize toward $75. Every dollar saved on CPL flows directly to the bottom line across every DMA.
2. **Prove the conversion** — First 3–5 DMAs establish the lead quality and attorney satisfaction that drives retention and referrals.
3. **Scale outreach systematically** — 300 reachouts/month is the baseline. Volume and close rate are the two levers that control growth speed.
4. **Build for retention** — Partner churn resets the compounding. Lead quality and attorney experience are the retention engine.
5. **Optimize lead volume per DMA** — Ramp from 1–2 leads/day to 3–4 as creative and funnels mature in each market.
6. **Launch premium nurturing (Month 4–6)** — Build the AI call/chat/text infrastructure. Start with highest-trust partners. The 4–5x revenue multiplier per DMA is the single biggest margin lever in the business.
7. **Introduce agency services (Month 4–6)** — Upsell brand identity, ad management, chatbots, email flows, websites. Deepens partner relationships and creates switching costs.
8. **Drive premium adoption** — Target 25% premium by end of Year 1, 40–60% by Year 2. Premium is where the business model transforms from lead gen into an intake infrastructure company.

### Cost Optimization Path

| Phase | Cost/Lead | Profit/Lead | Per Founder/Lead |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Launch (target)** | $150 | $250 | $83 |
| **Optimized** | $100 | $300 | $100 |
| **Fully optimized** | $75 | $325 | $108 |

Every $25 reduction in cost per lead at 100 DMAs × 3 leads/day = **$2.25M additional annual profit** ($750K per founder).

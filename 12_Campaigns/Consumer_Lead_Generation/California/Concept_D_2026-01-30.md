**Created:** January 30, 2026
**Status:** Ready for visual production
**State:** California
**Partner Firm:** Larry H. Parker (name ONLY in form/consent — stats OK in ads)

## THE CONCEPT

**Name:** They Brought Lawyers (Concept D)

**Strategic Insight:** Insurance companies have professional teams trained to minimize payouts. Victims negotiate alone, thinking it's a fair conversation. The asymmetry is invisible until you name it.

**Behavioral Stack:**
- **Primary:** Authority Bias — position the law firm as the equalizer
- **Amplifier 1:** Fear Appeal (calibrated) — make the villain real without exploitation
- **Amplifier 2:** Empathy Bridge — acknowledge the rigged system, offer the hero

**Form Alignment:** The quiz/estimate is positioned as "your first move" in the fight — strategy, not paperwork.

---

## THE FORMAT

**Format:** Story Slide (15 seconds)
- Works on: Meta Reels, IG Stories, FB Feed, IG Feed
- Production cost: ~$1.16/video
- NOT 3 static 5-second clips — fast cuts within scenes, VO-driven pacing, cuts every 1-2 seconds on key words

**Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 (vertical for Reels/Stories)

---

## THE LOCKED SCRIPT (C5)

```
Their lawyers. Their adjusters. Their rules.

The whole game is rigged.

California families are bringing their own team to the fight.

Your first move? See what you're owed.
```

**Word count:** 30 words
**Duration:** 15 seconds
**VO Style:** Bill (gruff, working-class) or Adam (deep, authoritative)

## VISUAL DIRECTION

### SCENE 1: THE VILLAIN (0:00 - ~0:05)
**Script lines:** "Their lawyers. Their adjusters. Their rules. The whole game is rigged."

**Visual concept:** 1A — The Corporate Machine
- Glass-walled conference room
- 4-5 lawyers/adjusters in suits reviewing documents
- Cold blue lighting, clinical, impersonal
- Multiple fast cuts within this scene:
  - Wide shot of the room
  - Close-up: hands on documents
  - Different angle: suits at table
  - Close-up: screens/data
- **Feeling:** Intimidating, powerful, you're up against a machine

**Motion:** Slight handheld movement, cold and clinical energy

---

### SCENE 2: THE CONTRAST / HERO ENTRY (0:05 - ~0:11)
**Script lines:** "California families are bringing their own team to the fight."

**Visual concept:** 2C — Living Room (Family Context) → Phone Action
- Living room, evening, warm golden light
- Kids' toys visible in background
- Person on couch, partner/friend visible
- Energy SHIFTS from isolation to determination
- Multiple cuts:
  - Wide: person on couch with paperwork, family context
  - Close: face, determined
  - Action: picking up phone, friend supporting
- **Feeling:** Not alone anymore. Fighting back together.

**Motion:** Handheld, documentary, warm, energy building

---

### SCENE 3: THE CTA (0:11 - 0:15)
**Script lines:** "Your first move? See what you're owed."

**Visual concept:** 3A — Phone Action with Support
- Hand holding phone, quiz/form interface visible
- Evening/night setting
- Friend visible in frame — they're talking about it, taking action together
- **Feeling:** This is the first punch. Strategic move. Easy.

**Motion:** Slight zoom into phone, purposeful energy

## AUDIO DIRECTION

### Voiceover
- **Voice:** Bill (gruff, working-class American) — primary choice
- **Alternative:** Adam (deep, mature, authoritative)
- **Settings:** Stability 0.75, Similarity 0.70, Style 0.15
- **Pacing:** Punchy, deliberate pauses between "Their lawyers. Their adjusters. Their rules."

### Music
- **Mood:** Building tension → fighting spirit → resolution
- **Style:** Driving, purposeful, not sad — this is a fight song
- **Volume:** 30% (underscore, never competing with VO)
- **Duration:** Full 15 seconds, continues ~2-3 sec after VO ends

### Environment SFX
- Scene 1: Office ambiance, papers rustling (cold)

## STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK

### Julian Cole (Head of Strategy)

**The Strategic Problem:** Insurance companies aren't just well-funded adversaries — they're MASSIVE, impersonal machines designed to minimize payouts. The asymmetry between a working family and a billion-dollar corporation is invisible until you name it.

**The Unlock:** Make the David vs. Goliath power imbalance VISCERAL — then position the law firm as the equalizer that puts the family back on even ground.

**Comms Architecture:**
- **Barrier:** Victims don't realize the system is stacked against them
- **Comms Task:** Visualize the asymmetry, then offer the solution
- **Channel Role:** Meta feed/Reels as pattern-interrupt + education

---

### Richard Shotton (Behavioral Scientist)

**Behavioral Stack:**

| Layer | Bias | Application |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Moral Inversion (Haidt) | Insurance companies profit when people accept less — frame as injustice being righted |
| **Amplifier 1** | Authority Asymmetry (Milgram) | People feel powerless against institutions — make the power differential visible, then give them an authority on THEIR side |
| **Amplifier 2** | In-Group Formation | The insurance company is the cold, corporate OTHER. The family is US. Create implicit permission to fight back by showing community |

**Power Score:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ (Maximum — three high-power biases stacking)

**Research Notes:** The "73% denied" data point on screen grounds the villain in REALITY, not fiction. Real numbers create real anger. Angry people click.

---

### Ed McCabe (Senior Copywriter)

**Voice Direction:** Third-person language throughout. "Colorado families" not "you." She's the center of a family, not a victim.

**LOCKED SCRIPT:**

```
One crash. One family. One claim.

On the other side? A machine that denies seventy-three percent 
before anyone even looks.

Your first move? See what you're owed.
```

**Word Count:** 33 words
**Pacing:** 2.2 words/second — tight but achievable with Bill's delivery
**VO Style:** Bill (gruff, working-class) — stability 0.75, similarity 0.70, style 0.15

**Copy Rationale:** "Your first move" is chess, not begging — positions the quiz as strategy. "See what you're owed" connects directly to the claim estimate form action. The "73%" data point grounds the villain in reality and pairs with the on-screen visual. Third-person compliant throughout.

---

### Depesh Mandalia (Meta Specialist)

**Platform Strategy:**
- Special Ad Categories applies (Social Issues) — no demographic targeting
- Creative does the qualifying: Maria's scrubs, the Accord, the Aurora apartment
- Run broad on all Colorado zip codes from targeting doc (2.16M addressable)
- The archetype specificity IS the targeting

**Format Unlocks:** Story Slide (MP4) unlocks Reels + Stories + Feed — 80% of cheap traffic

**Prediction:** Luca Maxim quality + Maria specificity = pattern interrupt in a feed full of UGC. Expect 30-35% hook rate if first frame lands.

---

### Indigo Sato (Performance Creative)

**Testing Structure:**
- This concept should spawn 3-4 hook variations once core is proven
- Different opening frames (POV vs. exterior vs. aftermath)
- Same villain beat, same resolution
- Same script across variations

**Success Metrics:**
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Hook Rate | >30% |
| CTR | >1.5% (cold) |
| CVR | >15% (quiz) |
| CPL | TBD based on CO baseline |

**Iteration Path:** If hook rate <25%, test new crash frames. If CTR good but CVR low, landing page issue. If all metrics strong, scale and spawn variations.

### Giuseppe Karma (AI Creative Director)

**Style Lock:** Luca Maxim cinematic — movie-trailer execution with satirical edge

**Visual Principles:**
- Every character is "starter pack perfect" — 10+ specific visual details
- Villain is CARTOONISHLY evil — not subtle, theatrical
- Hero is RECOGNIZABLY "us" — every detail reinforces relatability
- Motion is DRAMATIC — nothing subtle, high energy, Luca Maxim rules
- Color contrast: Cold blue (villain) → Warm gold (resolution)

**Production Pipeline:**
1. Character reference sheets (Nano Banana Pro)
2. Scene images with full detail prompts
3. Video animation (Kling 2.6 Pro)
4. Audio (ElevenLabs VO + environment + music)
5. Assembly with text overlays

### John Hegarty (Executive Creative Director)

**Quality Gate Assessment:**

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| **Clarity Test** | ✅ PASS — "Mom gets hit, insurance machine denies claims without looking, she makes her first move" — one sentence, clear |
| **Goosebump Test** | ✅ PASS — The swipe-DENY-swipe-DENY rhythm is hypnotic and infuriating. The booster seat in the crash raises stakes. Three generations watching her tap is earned emotion. |
| **Craft Test** | ✅ PASS — Every element earns its place. The booster seat, the Rolex check, the swipe motion, the mother in the doorway — all specific, all meaningful. |

**Verdict:** This is in the 10%. APPROVED for production.

**Notes:** "Treatment B is the one. The booster seat through the window — that's not just HER crash, that's her KIDS' near-miss. The swiping execs visualize 'before anyone even looks' — they're literally not looking. And 'Your first move' is chess, not begging. The quiz is strategy. Three generations watching her make the move — she's not alone, but she's the one who ACTS. That's hero framing."

---

## LOCKED VISUAL: Treatment B — "The Boardroom"

### BEAT 1A: THE CRASH — POV IMPACT (0:00 - 2.5 seconds)
*Script: "One crash."*

**Visual:**
- POV from inside Maria's Accord — rosary swinging from rearview mirror
- Her hands gripping the wheel, normal drive home
- Headlights flood the rearview mirror — RED DODGE RAM approaching fast
- IMPACT — Frame shakes violently, goes white for a flash

**Motion:** Smooth driving → sudden violent shake on impact

**Emotion Arc:** Normal day → VIOLENCE

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

### BEAT 1B: THE CRASH — AFTERMATH (2.5 - 5 seconds)
*Script: "One family. One claim."*

**Visual:**
- Exterior, approximately 20 minutes after impact (dusk, last light)
- Maria sits on the ground, back against the passenger-side rear of her damaged 2015 silver Honda Accord
- She holds her neck with one hand, dazed, processing pain and shock
- Red Dodge Ram truck crumpled into her rear bumper — the at-fault vehicle
- Truck driver stands in distant background, pacing, on phone
- Child's booster seat visible through shattered rear window — the stakes made visceral
- Light snow on ground, cold enough to see breath (Colorado winter)
- Rocky Mountain foothills visible in background, dusted with snow
- Harsh overhead streetlight creates sharp shadows
- Emergency flashers cast orange-red pulse across the scene

**Motion:** Very slow, documentary-style. Maria barely moves. Her breath visible in cold air. Emergency lights pulse. Snowflakes drift lazily.

**Emotion Arc:** AFTERMATH → Stakes revealed (booster seat) → Vulnerability

**Key Detail:** The booster seat through the shattered rear window is the scroll-stopper. The cold, the isolation, the visible pain — this is someone who could be you.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Production Image Prompt (Nano Banana Pro):**
```
A 38-year-old Latina woman sits on cold asphalt at dusk, her back 
resting against the crumpled passenger-side rear of her damaged 
2015 silver Honda Accord. She wears a worn grey hoodie over light 
blue medical scrubs, white sneakers slightly dirty. One hand grips 
her neck — pain, whiplash, daze — her face a mask of shock and 
exhaustion. Tears streak down her cheeks but she is not sobbing. 
Dark brown hair loose, partially fallen from a messy ponytail. 
Small gold stud earrings, thin gold chain with small cross visible.

The red Dodge Ram pickup truck that rear-ended her is crumpled 
against her car's trunk. The truck driver — a middle-aged man in 
a flannel jacket — stands 15 feet away, pacing, phone pressed to ear.

Through the shattered rear window of the Accord: A CHILD'S BOOSTER 
SEAT — the family this could have destroyed.

The ground has LIGHT SNOW, thin layer, Colorado winter cold. Her 
BREATH IS VISIBLE in the frigid air.

Background: Rocky Mountain foothills dusted with snow, silhouetted 
against fading dusk sky. An intersection with older strip mall 
storefronts — pawn shop, nail salon, taqueria with neon sign. 
Harsh overhead streetlight creates sharp shadows.

Emergency vehicle flashers cast orange-red pulse across the scene. 
No emergency personnel visible yet — she is ALONE with the aftermath.

Luca Maxim cinematic style — hyperrealistic, movie-trailer quality, 
dramatic composition, shallow depth of field, the emotional weight 
of a pivotal life moment captured in a single frame. Film grain, 
color graded cool with warm emergency light accents.
```

**Production Video Prompt (Kling 2.6 Pro):**
```
Camera holds STEADY on Maria — documentary stillness, bearing witness.

SUBTLE MOTION ONLY:
- Maria's BREATH visible in cold air, rhythmic, shaky exhales
- Her hand on neck TREMBLES slightly — processing pain
- Eyes BLINK slowly, thousand-yard stare, shell-shocked
- A single tear tracks down her cheek

BACKGROUND MOTION:
- Emergency FLASHERS pulse orange-red across scene rhythmically
- SNOWFLAKES drift lazily through the harsh streetlight beam
- Truck driver PACES in background, gesturing on phone call

THE BOOSTER SEAT sits motionless through shattered glass — 
silent accusation, the stakes made visceral.

No camera movement. The stillness IS the drama. The world 
moves around her while she sits frozen in aftermath.

Hyperrealistic, Luca Maxim cinematic style, film grain, 
the weight of a life-changing moment rendered in motion.
```

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Production Image Prompt (Nano Banana Pro):**
```
A massive open-plan insurance company operations floor — the belly 
of the beast. Cold blue fluorescent lighting, glass partitions, 
sleek modern corporate architecture.

GIANT LED SCREEN dominates the back wall, blood red display: 
"73% DENIED" in huge bold numbers.

A BRASS DENIAL BELL mounted on a marble column — one executive 
in a $5,000 charcoal pinstripe suit reaches up dramatically to 
RING IT, face twisted in triumphant glee.

20+ employees in expensive suits WILDLY CELEBRATING like it's 
New Year's Eve on Wall Street:

Demographics: mostly white men, 40s-60s, silver hair, soft from 
wealth, gold watches, French cuffs, signet rings.

The celebration is OBSCENE — a ticker tape parade for cruelty.

Luca Maxim cinematic style — hyperrealistic, movie-trailer 
quality, dramatic wide angle composition, the grotesque excess 
of corporate evil made visible. Film grain, cold color grade 
with red accent from the screen.
```

**Production Video Prompt (Kling 2.6 Pro):**
```
Camera RAPIDLY PUSHES IN toward the "73% DENIED" screen as chaos 
erupts around it.

THE DENIAL BELL: Executive's hand PULLS the rope, the bell RINGS, 
sound reverberates through the space.

WILD CELEBRATION explodes:
- Executives JUMP from their seats
- HIGH-FIVES exchanged across desks
- CHAMPAGNE corks POP, foam sprays
- PAPERS thrown in the air, fluttering down

- Fists PUMP in the air
- Laughter, shouting, chaos

Camera continues pushing toward the screen, executives blur past 
on either side, until "73% DENIED" fills the frame.

accent.

### BEAT 2C: THE MACHINE — BEFORE ANYONE LOOKS (8 - 10 seconds)
*Script: "before anyone even looks."*

**Visual:**
- Industrial insurance processing floor — THE MACHINE made literal
- Long conveyor belt carries stacks of claim files
- An automated STAMPING MACHINE punches "DENIED" in red ink on each file
- Files continue down conveyor belt, DROP into an industrial SHREDDER at the end

**Motion:** Conveyor belt moves continuously. Stamper punches rhythmically: DENIED, DENIED, DENIED. Papers shred. Executives walk by laughing, not looking at the claims. The machine runs without human attention.

**Emotion Arc:** HORROR — "they literally don't look, it's automated cruelty"

**Key Detail:** The shredding visualizes the finality. The laughing executives not even watching visualizes "before anyone even looks."

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Production Image Prompt (Nano Banana Pro):**
```
An industrial insurance claim processing floor — a factory of denial.

A long CONVEYOR BELT runs through the center of the frame, carrying 
stacks of white claim files with blue headers. Medical documents, 
accident reports, desperate handwritten notes visible on the papers.

A massive automated STAMPING MACHINE at center — mechanical arm 
rises and CRASHES down, punching "DENIED" in blood-red ink onto 
each file. Red ink splatter visible around the stamp mechanism.

The belt continues to an INDUSTRIAL SHREDDER at the end — papers 
feed in, shredded confetti spills into a pile below.

IN THE BACKGROUND: Three executives in expensive charcoal pinstripe 
suits walk past, LAUGHING among themselves, cocktail glasses in hand. 
They do not look at the machine. They do not look at the files. 
The cruelty runs itself.

Cold blue industrial lighting, metallic surfaces, steam vents along 
the walls. The aesthetic of a factory floor — claims as product, 
denial as manufacturing.

Luca Maxim cinematic style — hyperrealistic, movie-trailer quality, 
dramatic composition, the horror of automated injustice. Film grain, 
cold industrial color grade.
```

**Production Video Prompt (Kling 2.6 Pro):**
```
Camera TRACKS SLOWLY along the conveyor belt, following a stack 
of claims on their journey.

THE MACHINE IN MOTION:
- Conveyor belt moves at steady industrial pace
- Claims pass under the STAMPER — mechanical arm RISES and CRASHES 
  down: "DENIED" punched in red ink
- The rhythm is relentless: stamp, advance, stamp, advance
- Claims reach the end and FEED INTO SHREDDER
- Shredded paper confetti SPILLS out in continuous stream

BACKGROUND:
- Three executives walk past, LAUGHING, glasses in hand
- They don't glance at the machine
- Their laughter contrasts with the mechanical violence of denial

The "DENIED" text on each file must remain READABLE — 
the stamp motion is crisp and clear.

Cold industrial atmosphere, steam vents releasing wisps, 
the mechanical heartbeat of injustice.

Luca Maxim cinematic style, film grain, cold blue color grade, 
the horror of automation made visceral.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Production Image Prompt (Nano Banana Pro):**
```
Maria's Aurora apartment living room — warm, lived-in, the anti-boardroom.

MARIA (38, Latina, dark hair in loose ponytail, worn grey hoodie over 
light blue medical scrubs) sits on a brown sectional couch. Her face 
shows deep emotion — eyes red-rimmed, tears on cheeks, but jaw set 
with emerging determination. She holds an older iPhone in both hands, 
the screen glowing with a form to fill out.

HER HUSBAND (40, Latino, work-worn hands, plaid flannel shirt) sits 
BESIDE her on the couch, one arm wrapped fully around her shoulders, 
pulling her close. His other hand reaches over and covers BOTH her 
hands holding the phone — steadying her, with her, partnership made 
physical.

GRANDMOTHER (65+, silver-streaked hair in a bun, simple floral apron) 
stands CLOSE, having just walked from the kitchen doorway. She carries 
a BABY (8 months old) on her hip — the baby fidgets, grabbing at 
grandma's apron, small movements of life. Grandmother's FREE HAND 
rests on Maria's head — a blessing, a transfer of strength, the touch 
of a mother who's been through hard things.

THREE GENERATIONS TOUCHING MARIA — husband's arm around her, 
grandmother's hand on her head.

ENVIRONMENT: Virgin Mary candle glows golden on the shelf. Son's 
basketball trophy catches light. Quinceañera photos in ornate frames. 
Well-worn Bible on the end table. Kids' toys in the corner. 
Ceiling fan turns slowly.

WARM GOLDEN evening light streams through windows — complete visual 
contrast from cold blue corporate spaces. The warmth of home vs. 
the cold of the machine.

Luca Maxim cinematic style — hyperrealistic, movie-trailer quality, 
intimate and emotional, the power of family support visualized. 
Film grain, warm color grade, the beauty of ordinary heroism.
```

**Production Video Prompt (Kling 2.6 Pro):**
```
Camera SLOWLY PUSHES IN toward Maria as the family MOVES around her 
with love and support.

MARIA is emotional — shoulders shaking slightly, wiping her eye 
with the back of her hand, taking shaky breaths. She holds the 
phone, looks at it, looks away, looks back. The weight of the 
decision is VISIBLE on her face. She's processing, struggling, 
gathering courage.

HER HUSBAND sits down BESIDE her on the couch, wrapping his arm 
fully around her shoulders, pulling her close. He LEANS IN, 
whispers something in her ear. His other hand reaches over and 
covers BOTH her hands holding the phone — steadying her. He 
rubs her back in slow comforting circles. He's actively THERE.

THE GRANDMOTHER walks TOWARD them from the kitchen doorway, 
carrying a BABY on her hip. The baby fidgets, grabbing at 
grandma's apron. She approaches slowly, watching her daughter 
with quiet strength, then reaches out and places a weathered 
hand on Maria's head — a blessing, a transfer of strength. 
Three generations touching.

STAGGERED GENTLE MOTION:
- Maria: Wiping eyes, shaky breath, gathering resolve
- Husband: Leaning in, whispering, rubbing her back, hands covering hers
- Grandmother: Walking in with baby, approaching, touching Maria's head
- Baby: Fidgeting, small movements, grabbing grandma's clothes
- The ceiling fan turns slowly, candle flickers

Maria takes a DEEP BREATH, nods to herself, steadies. Her 
husband gives one final squeeze. Grandmother's hand stays on 
her head. Maria's thumb moves — THE TAP. Done.

Her face shifts: relief, determination, the beginning of hope. 
She leans into her husband. Grandmother nods with quiet pride.

Camera continues slow push ending on the family clustered 
together — three generations, one decision, united.

Warm golden light, intimate, emotional, the family ALIVE 
with supportive motion, film grain, the drama of love in action.

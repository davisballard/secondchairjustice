## Story Slide Creative Brief

**Created:** February 5, 2026
**Status:** IN DEVELOPMENT — Script locked, visual mapping in progress
**State:** Colorado
**Partner Firm:** Jacoby & Meyers (name ONLY in form/consent — stats OK in ads)
**Consumer Brand:** Claim Justice Now

## CONCEPT SUMMARY

**Name:** On The Nose (Direct Opportunity)

**One-Sentence Concept:** A Colorado mom gets in a crash, and discovers that families like hers have recovered millions — all it takes is sixty seconds to find out.

**Format:** Story Slide (15 seconds) — Luca Maxim cinematic style
**Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 (vertical for Reels/Stories/Feed)
**Platform:** Meta (Instagram Reels, Stories, FB Feed)

**Key Difference from "The Boardroom":** No villain. No insurance company antagonist. No anger activation. Pure protagonist journey from crash → opportunity → action. Optimized for Stage 4 decision-makers ready to act.

---

## LOCKED SCRIPT: Version B — "The Numbers Forward"

```
Accident cases in Colorado have settled for millions.

Most people never find out what they're owed.

Free claim estimate. Sixty seconds. 
See what experienced attorneys can do.
```

**Word Count:** 30 words
**Pacing:** 2.0 words/second — punchy, leaves room for breath
**VO Style:** Bill (gruff, working-class) — stability 0.75, similarity 0.70, style 0.15

### NEEDS GENERATION ⏳

| Beat | Time | Script Line | Visual Needed | Status |
|------|------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 2A | 4-6s | "Most people never find out..." | Kitchen table WIDE — bills, empty chair | ⏳ PENDING |
| 2B | 6-8s | "...what they're owed." | Morning window — light, dust, hope | ⏳ PENDING |
| 3B | 11-15s | "See what experienced attorneys can do." | Law office — family + 8 lawyers, Colorado | ⏳ PENDING |

**Total new clips needed:** 3 (one image + video each)

---

## BEAT 2 OPTIONS (Choose One)

The middle section (4-8 seconds) needs a visual that communicates "most people miss this opportunity" without introducing a villain.

### OPTION A: The Scroll-Past (Recommended)
**Concept:** POV of someone scrolling on their phone, accident-related content flying by unnoticed — bills, forms, insurance letters — until a "Free Claim Estimate" notification pauses the scroll.

**Visual:**
- POV smartphone screen, thumb scrolling rapidly
- Content blurs past: medical bills, insurance documents, missed calls
- The scroll STOPS on a notification or form that says "Free Claim Estimate"
- Warm light enters the frame

**Why it works:** Shows the "missed opportunity" without a villain. It's about what people DON'T do, not what's done TO them.

**Production complexity:** Medium — need phone screen content + scrolling animation

---

### OPTION B: The Kitchen Table (Simple)
**Concept:** Wide shot of Maria's kitchen table — medical bills, insurance letters scattered, coffee getting cold. She's not there. The opportunity sits unaddressed.

**Visual:**
- Maria's Aurora apartment kitchen (same warm palette as Beat 3)
- Table covered with medical bills, insurance envelope (partially opened), phone face-down
- Empty chair — she's not dealing with it yet
- Morning light through window, the warmth of possibility

**Why it works:** Shows the problem waiting to be solved. Domestic, relatable, not dramatic.

**Production complexity:** Low — single static or slow-pan shot

---

### OPTION C: The Numbers Overlay (Cheapest)
**Concept:** Text-heavy beat. Dark/neutral background with animated text: "MILLIONS RECOVERED" → "MOST PEOPLE NEVER CHECK" → builds to the CTA.

**Visual:**
- Simple motion graphics
- Bold yellow text (matching existing overlay style)
- Could layer over slow-motion of existing footage (crash aftermath, Maria's hands)

**Why it works:** Lets the copy do the work. Fast to produce.

**Production complexity:** Very low — motion graphics only

---

### OPTION D: The Extended Aftermath
**Concept:** Use more footage from Beat 1B — hold longer on Maria at the crash scene, processing, looking at her phone for the first time.

**Visual:**
- Same Maria crash scene from Beat 1B
- Extended hold — she takes a breath, pulls out phone, starts to search
- Bridge directly into Beat 3 (family couch)

**Why it works:** No new generation needed. Just hold the existing shot longer.

**Production complexity:** Zero — editorial only

---

## RECOMMENDED: OPTION B (Kitchen Table)

**Rationale:**
1. Maintains Luca Maxim cinematic quality (single beautiful shot)
2. Introduces no new characters or locations (same apartment as Beat 3)
3. Communicates "ignored opportunity" without drama
4. Fast to generate (one image → one video clip)
5. Emotional register stays warm throughout (no villain cold-blue contrast needed)

---

## BEAT 2: KITCHEN TABLE — Production Specs

**Duration:** 4 seconds total (4-8s in timeline)
**Clips Needed:** 2 clips × 2 seconds each (Kling max ~5s, but 2s clips cut better)

*Script: "Most people never find out what they're owed."*

---

### BEAT 2A: THE TABLE — Wide Shot (4-6 seconds)
*Script: "Most people never find out..."*

**Visual:**
- Maria's Aurora apartment kitchen, morning light streaming through window
- WIDE SHOT of wooden kitchen table, worn but clean
- SCATTERED ON TABLE:
  - Medical bill (visible header: "BALANCE DUE")
  - Insurance envelope (opened, letter partially pulled out)
  - Prescription bottle
  - Coffee mug, half-full, getting cold
  - Maria's phone face-down (she's avoiding it)
- EMPTY CHAIR — she's not there, she's not dealing with it
- In background: kids' drawings on fridge, Virgin Mary calendar

**Motion:** Slow push-in toward the table. Documentary stillness.

**Emotion Arc:** "Most people" = avoidance, the opportunity sitting untouched

---

**Production Image Prompt — Beat 2A (Nano Banana Pro):**
```
Interior of a working-class Aurora, Colorado apartment kitchen. 
Morning light streams through a window with simple curtains. 
WIDE SHOT showing the full scene.

A worn wooden kitchen table, clean but showing years of use. 

SCATTERED ON THE TABLE:
- A medical bill, white paper with red "BALANCE DUE" header visible
- An insurance company envelope, opened, letter partially pulled out
- An orange prescription medication bottle
- A ceramic coffee mug, half-full, no steam (getting cold)
- A smartphone placed FACE-DOWN on the table

AN EMPTY WOODEN CHAIR at the table — no one is sitting there. 
The person who should be dealing with this is NOT dealing with it.

BACKGROUND DETAILS:
- Refrigerator with kids' drawings held by magnets
- Virgin Mary calendar on wall
- Small potted plant on windowsill
- Family photos in simple frames

Warm golden morning light fills the space — hopeful, not sad. 
The same color palette as a loving family home.

Luca Maxim cinematic style — hyperrealistic, movie-quality 
composition, shallow depth of field, the quiet weight of an 
unaddressed moment. Film grain, warm color grade.
```

---

**Production Video Prompt — Beat 2A (Kling 2.6 Pro):**
```
WIDE SHOT of kitchen table. Camera SLOWLY PUSHES IN.
Documentary stillness — bearing witness to absence.

SUBTLE MOTION ONLY:
- Morning light shifts almost imperceptibly
- Dust particles float in the sunbeam
- The coffee in the mug is perfectly still (no steam — cold)

The EMPTY CHAIR is visible — the person who should be 
here is not here. They haven't faced this yet.

Very slow push-in, almost imperceptible movement. 
The stillness IS the story.

Luca Maxim cinematic style, warm morning light, 
film grain, the quiet domestic drama of avoidance.

Duration: 2-3 seconds.
```

---

### BEAT 2B: MORNING WINDOW — Light Detail (6-8 seconds)
*Script: "...what they're owed."*

**Visual:**
- Morning light streaming through a kitchen window
- Dust particles floating in the sunbeam
- Simple, abstract, hopeful
- The "new day" = new opportunity vibe

**Motion:** Static or very slow. Dust drifts. Light is warm.

**Emotion Arc:** "What they're owed" = possibility, a new day, something waiting

**Why this works:** Abstract shot is easy for video gen, provides visual breathing room, and transitions naturally to Beat 3 (family scene also has warm light).

---

**Production Image Prompt — Beat 2B (Nano Banana Pro):**
```
Morning sunlight streaming through a simple kitchen window.
The window has basic white curtains, slightly open.

GOLDEN LIGHT fills the frame — warm, hopeful, inviting.
Dust particles float visibly in the sunbeam.

The window is in a working-class home — clean but simple.
Maybe a small potted plant on the windowsill, slightly wilted.
A glimpse of the kitchen in soft focus below the frame.

The feeling is: a new day. Possibility. Something waiting.

Luca Maxim cinematic style — hyperrealistic, shallow depth 
of field focused on the light and particles, film grain, 
warm golden color grade. Intimate domestic detail.
```

---

**Production Video Prompt — Beat 2B (Kling 2.6 Pro):**
```
Morning sunlight streaming through a kitchen window.
Camera holds STILL.

MINIMAL MOTION ONLY:
- Dust particles DRIFT slowly through the sunbeam
- Light shifts almost imperceptibly
- Curtains remain still

This is an abstract, contemplative beat.
The warmth of morning. The possibility of a new day.

The light is GOLDEN and hopeful — not cold, not sad.
This is the bridge between "what they're owed" and 
"here's how to find out."

Static shot. Let the dust particles do the work.

Luca Maxim cinematic style, warm morning light,
film grain, intimate domestic detail.

Duration: 2 seconds.
```

---

## BEAT 3B ALT: LAW OFFICE RESOLUTION — Production Specs

**Duration:** 3-4 seconds (end of video, 11-15s)
**Script:** "See what experienced attorneys can do."

**Concept:** Maria's family surrounded by a team of champion lawyers in a prestigious but warm Colorado law office. The visual says: "This is what's waiting for you. A team that wins AND cares."

**IMPORTANT:** The Maria family should match the existing character from Beats 1B and 3A. Use the same reference images or composite the existing family into this scene.

### NOTES ON FAMILY CONTINUITY

To maintain character consistency across beats:

1. **Option A (Recommended):** Generate this image separately, then composite the Maria family from Beat 1B/3A reference images into the law office scene in post
2. **Option B:** Use the Maria family description as reference for the AI, accepting some variation
3. **Option C:** Generate multiple versions and select the one that best matches existing Maria

The lawyers can vary — they're new characters. The FAMILY must match.

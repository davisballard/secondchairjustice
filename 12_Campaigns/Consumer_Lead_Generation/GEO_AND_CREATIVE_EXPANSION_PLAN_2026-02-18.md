## Context

Second Chair generates its own consumer leads through ad campaigns across Meta and Google. This plan governs which states to build next, in what order, and what creative formats to test across the portfolio.

Our campaigns give us full margin, complete creative control, and the data advantage of running our own funnels end-to-end.

---

## State Priority Order

### 1. Colorado — BUILD OUT FULLY (Immediate)
**Status:** Already have two locked concepts in production.

| Concept | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| The Boardroom | `../B2B_Attorney_Acquisition/06_Colorado/Boardroom_Concept_2026-02-02.md` | IN PRODUCTION — assets generated, assembly pending |
| On The Nose | `../B2B_Attorney_Acquisition/06_Colorado/On_The_Nose_Concept_2026-02-05.md` | IN DEVELOPMENT — 2 beats left to generate |

**Why priority 1:** Already validated market. Our campaigns generate leads directly with full margin and creative learnings. Run both concepts as A/B test (anger vs. hope).

**Targeting logic:** Metro Denver/Aurora. Maria archetype. Geo in creative copy — not Meta targeting parameters (Special Ad Categories restriction). Broad + strong creative = algorithm does the filtering.

**Next actions:**
- [ ] Complete asset generation for "On The Nose" (Beats 2A, 2B, 3B)
- [ ] Assemble "The Boardroom" in CapCut
- [ ] Run Saul compliance review on both
- [ ] Upload both to Airtable, launch as A/B test
- [ ] Once winner identified, spawn 3-4 hook variations from the winner

---

### 2. Washington — BUILD ALONGSIDE COLORADO
**Status:** No consumer campaigns yet.

**Why now:** Build Washington while Colorado is in assembly — same Maria archetype applies, different geo copy. Colorado CPL benchmarks will inform Washington targeting.

**Approach:** Adapt winning Colorado concept for Washington context. Swap geo references (Denver/Aurora → Seattle metro, I-5, Tacoma corridor). Same emotional engine. New copy to reflect Washington accident landscape.

**Targeting:** Seattle metro, Tacoma, Bellevue/Eastside. Same broad targeting + geo-in-copy approach.

**Next actions:**
- [ ] Wait for Colorado A/B results (7-10 days post-launch)
- [ ] Adapt winning Colorado concept with Washington geo copy
- [ ] Identify Washington-specific archetype details (commute routes, cultural markers)
- [ ] Build and launch

---

### 3. California — TEST BUDGET, METRO-FIRST
**Status:** One concept exists (`../B2B_Attorney_Acquisition/02_California/Concept_D_2026-01-30.md`). Market is hard (high CPMs, competition) but J&M needs California leads specifically.

**Why we go after it anyway:** J&M needs California. High CPMs are a moat — they keep weak operators out. If we deliver quality California leads, that's leverage in the relationship.

**Approach:** Metro-first. LA basin, San Diego, Inland Empire corridor. Do not run state-wide — too diffuse to learn from. Set CPL ceiling going in (expect higher than CO/WA) and hold to it.

**Expected CPL:** Materially higher than Colorado. Price accordingly or negotiate rate card.

**Next actions:**
- [ ] Review existing California concept — assess for adaptation
- [ ] Set CPL ceiling and kill criteria before spending a dollar
- [ ] Launch test budget (enough for signal, not enough to hurt)
- [ ] Evaluate after 2 weeks — scale metro winners, cut underperformers

### Nevada — OFF
**Client intelligence:** Jacoby & Myers flagged Nevada leads as consistently low quality. Do not build campaigns here.

---

## Case Type Strategy

### Broad MVA — Always Running (The Volume Engine)
Standard auto accident creative. Broad targeting + strong creative. This is the workhorse. It fills the pipeline. Never kill it in favor of niche.

### High-Value Niche — Parallel Test (Not a Replacement)
**Trucking / Commercial Vehicle / Rideshare** MVA cases are worth more per case but lower in volume. Run as a separate test campaign — separate creative, same states.

**How to qualify without targeting:** The hook does the work.
- *"Were you hit by a commercial truck or delivery vehicle?"*
- *"Involved in a rideshare accident? Uber and Lyft cases settle differently."*

Self-selecting creative attracts the right leads in Special Ad Categories where demographic/interest targeting is prohibited.

**Budget split:** 70% broad MVA / 30% high-value niche (until niche data justifies rebalancing).

---

## Creative Format Testing Plan

### What's Already Working — Keep Running
- **Story-driven reels (15s)** — The Boardroom / On The Nose style. Luca Maxim cinematic. Maria archetype. Don't abandon this. It's the proven format.

### New Formats to Test (Priority Order)

#### Format 1: Short Pattern Interrupt Reels (5-8 seconds)
Pure hook. The entire ad IS the hook. No story arc — just a scroll-stopping visual + text overlay + CTA.

**Why test it:** Cheap to produce, fast signal. If the hook concept has legs, you find out in 48 hours without a full production cycle.

**Format:** 9:16 vertical. Bold text overlay. Native/iPhone quality preferred. Hard CTA.

**Examples to brief:**
- Crash aftermath image → "Colorado families have recovered millions. Start here."
- Car damage close-up → "A car accident isn't just inconvenient. Find out what it's worth."

---

#### Format 2: Static with Text Overlay (Ugly Ads Doctrine)
Fastest to produce. Cheapest to test. Compete surprisingly well against video in-feed.

**Why test it:** One image + one overlay = 30 minutes of production vs. days for a reel. High testing velocity.

**Format:** Strong situational image (car damage, accident scene — compliant, no graphic content). Bold yellow text (#FFD700, black stroke). Direct copy.

**Examples:**
- Car damage exterior → "Colorado: Was your accident someone else's fault? See what you're owed."
- Tow truck scene → "Washington families who file claims recover more. It's free to check."

---

#### Format 3: Testimonial / Social Proof Style (15-20 seconds)
Non-produced, UGC-style talking head. Actor or spokesperson in a natural setting (car, home, outside). NOT a real client (TCPA/compliance risk) — use actors with authentic delivery.

**Why test it:** Bridges the story-driven format and the shorter formats. High iteratability — same body, swap hooks. Emotional trust signal.

**Compliance note:** Third-person language. Must not represent a specific client outcome.

**Hook examples:**
- *"I didn't know I could still file a claim six months after my accident..."*
- *"Most people in Colorado don't know this about their accident..."*

---

#### Format 4: Educational Hook (Trucking/Rideshare Specific)
For high-value niche campaigns. Self-qualifying by nature.

**Why test it:** People who stop for this are exactly who we want. The creative IS the targeting.

**Hook examples:**
- *"What most people don't know about Uber and Lyft accident claims..."*
- *"Why commercial truck accidents are handled differently — and worth more."*
- *"If a delivery driver hit you, this changes everything about your claim."*

**Format:** Video preferred (15-20s). Static works for feed.

---

### Testing Structure (3-2-2 Method)

For each new format launch:
- 3 hooks × 2 bodies × 2 CTAs = 12 variations
- Evaluate after 7-10 days
- Winners get budget. Losers get cut.
- Near-winners get iterated (new hooks on winning body)

**Kill criteria:** Under 0.5% CTR after 1,000 impressions. CPL above ceiling after $X spend. Define ceiling per state before launch.

## The "Maria" Targeting Approach — How It Works in Special Ad Categories

Meta prohibits zip code targeting, demographic targeting, and interest targeting for PI/Legal campaigns (Special Ad Categories — Social Issues). The "Maria targeting" approach works **through creative, not targeting settings**.

**The method:**
1. Identify the specific archetype (working-class, high-commute, specific ethnicity, specific metro)
2. Embed that identity in every visual detail (her scrubs, her Accord, her apartment, Aurora zip codes mentioned in copy)
3. Run broad — let Advantage+ find the audience
4. The archetype specificity IS the targeting. People who see themselves in the ad self-select. Others scroll past.

**To replicate this in Washington:** Identify Washington-equivalent archetype. What does she drive on I-5? Where does she live? What does her commute look like? Build that specificity into the creative.

## Current Asset Inventory

| State | Concept | Format | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| Colorado | The Boardroom | Story Reel 15s | IN PRODUCTION |
| Colorado | On The Nose | Story Reel 15s | IN DEVELOPMENT |
| California | Concept D | TBD | Existing — review needed |
| Washington | — | — | Not started |

### Gaps to Fill (Priority Order)
1. Complete Colorado production → Launch A/B test
2. Build Washington adaptation of Colorado winner
3. Test 5-8s pattern interrupt format (all states)
4. Test static format (fastest to build — start immediately as parallel test)
5. Build trucking/rideshare niche campaign (CO first, then WA)
6. Push California test budget with existing concept

## Lead Generation Strategy

All leads are generated through our own campaigns. Full margin, full funnel ownership, full creative control. The margin between our cost per lead ($75–$150) and our sale price ($400) is where the business model lives.

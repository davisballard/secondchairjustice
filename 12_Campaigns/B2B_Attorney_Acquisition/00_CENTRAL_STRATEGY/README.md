# Central B2B Messaging Strategy

**Purpose:** Core messaging, positioning, and creative frameworks that apply across all state markets

---

## 🔄 POSITIONING UPDATE (Feb 2026)

**Fused positioning framework now integrates this work:**

The "hero lawyer" positioning and insights in this folder are now part of a complete fused framework that combines **emotional depth** (hero narrative) with **rational core** (website messaging).

**📍 Before creating new B2B content, read:**
1. **[`BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md`](../../../01_Identity/BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md)** — How rational + emotional layers work together
2. **[`AD_MESSAGING_FRAMEWORK.md`](../../../03_Voice/AD_MESSAGING_FRAMEWORK.md)** — Application templates and techniques

**How to use this folder:**
- The insights here (hero lawyer, pride, identity) = **emotional layer**
- Add website rational messaging (geo-exclusive, 92% acceptance, $1,600 per case) = **rational core**
- Result = **complete B2B positioning**

## Key Principle

**Everything here is market-agnostic.** State-specific pain points, regulatory nuances, and competitive dynamics go in the state folders (e.g., `01_New_York/`).

This folder contains the **universal truths** that apply to every PI attorney in every market:
- They want cases, not clicks
- They care about cost-per-signed-case, not CPL
- They have pride in their work and hate being called ambulance chasers
- They're fighting well-funded insurance companies
- They need volume but also need quality

Build state-specific creative ON TOP OF this foundation.

# New York B2B Video Ad Scripts
## NYC-Specific Creative Concepts for Law Firm Acquisition

**Status:** 📋 TO DO — Complete after NY_MARKET_BRIEF.md is finished  
**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026  
**Purpose:** NYC-tailored video scripts based on market research and "hero lawyer" positioning

---

## Script Development Guidelines

### The NYC Difference
- NYC attorneys are sophisticated, data-driven, and skeptical
- They've been burned by bad lead vendors
- They care about serious injury threshold qualification
- They're paying $400-$500/click on Google and know it
- They face the most well-funded defense attorneys in the nation

### Creative Principles
1. **Respect their intelligence** — Show the math, cite the data, be specific
2. **Address the serious injury threshold** — This is THE NYC pain point
3. **Lead with ROI, not price** — Cost-per-signed-case is what matters
4. **Honor the "hero lawyer" positioning** — They change lives; we help them do it
5. **Differentiate from commodity vendors** — Exclusive, qualified, NYC-specialists

## Production Notes

### Visual Style Considerations
[TO BE COMPLETED after creative direction is defined]

- Real lawyer testimonials vs. scripted actor?
- NYC skyline/imagery vs. generic/universal?
- Data visualizations (charts, graphs) vs. narrative storytelling?
- Talking head vs. voice-over + B-roll?

### Talent Considerations
- Use actual NYC PI attorney as spokesperson?
- Voice-over talent (professional VO vs. authentic lawyer voice)?

## NYC Market Quick Facts

### The Pain Points
1. **Serious Injury Threshold:** NY is no-fault, but plaintiffs can only sue if injury meets "serious injury" threshold (fracture, permanent loss of use, significant limitation, etc.). This creates qualification complexity.

2. **Highest Google CPC in Nation:** NYC PI keywords hit $400-$500/click. Firms are bleeding money.

3. **Sophisticated Defense:** NYC has the most well-funded, aggressive insurance defense attorneys in the country. Firms need every advantage.

4. **High Case Values but High Overhead:** NYC settlements are 25-30% higher than upstate, but rent, salaries, and operating costs are also extreme. Cost-per-case matters more here than anywhere.

### The Opportunity
- NYC firms are data-driven and track ROI religiously
- They understand cost-per-signed-case economics
- They're willing to pay premium pricing for quality (already paying $400-$500/click)
- Local sales advantage (our guy is there, can do in-person meetings)
- High volume capacity (firms handle 50-200+ cases/year)

### The Messaging Angle
**Don't compete on price. Compete on qualification and ROI.**

NYC firms have been burned by cheap shared leads that don't clear the serious injury threshold. Position Second Chair as the **serious injury specialists** — we understand NY's legal environment and pre-qualify aggressively.

**Pricing:** $375-$450/lead (premium market, premium pricing)

**Value Story:** Google delivers $8,000+ effective CPL. We deliver $375 with 3x better conversion because we pre-qualify for serious injury threshold. Cost-per-signed-case: $2,000-$3,000 (vs. Google's $40,000-$60,000).

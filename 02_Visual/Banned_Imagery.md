## The Neuroscience of Why These Fail

Understanding Kahneman's System 1 (fast, emotional) vs System 2 (slow, logical) processing is critical:

- **System 1 triggers work:** Faces, checks, notifications process in milliseconds
- **Trauma imagery backfires:** Danger signals trigger freeze response, not action
- **The key insight:** You want System 1 arousal that leads to click, not paralysis

> **The core problem with banned imagery:** It activates the reptilian "danger" response but provides no clear escape path. Fear without efficacy = paralysis, not conversion.

---

## Why This Matters (Behavioral Science)

Beyond platform compliance, banned imagery fails for psychological reasons:

| Problem | Behavioral Principle | Effect |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| Trauma/distress imagery | **Fear without Efficacy** (Janis & Feshbach) | Fear paralyzes without clear solution |
| Graphic content | **Negativity Bias Overload** (Baumeister) | Too much negative = avoidance |
| Exploitation feeling | **Reactance** (Brehm) | Perceived manipulation = rejection |
| Victimhood focus | **Loss of Agency** | People want empowerment, not pity |

**The insight:** Show the story from the *recovery chapter*, not the trauma chapter.

---

## Instant Rejection (Auto-Reject)

### Blood & Visible Injuries
- Blood (any amount, any context)
- Bruises visible on skin
- Open wounds, cuts, scrapes
- Visible broken bones or deformities
- Bandages with blood showing through

**Why banned:** Meta Chapter 13 (Sensational Content) — triggers "exploitation" flags.

---

### Trauma & Distress
- Hospital beds with patient in distress
- Crash footage (real or simulated) with visible damage to people
- Crying/distressed faces looking directly at camera
- Before/after injury comparisons
- Person in visible pain or anguish
- Victim at accident scene

**Why banned:** Personal Attributes + Sensational Content = algorithm death.

**Behavioral insight:** Showing distress without solution activates fear paralysis, not action.

> **Saul says:** "Meta's algorithm sees this and thinks 'exploitation.' And when the algorithm thinks exploitation, it doesn't send a warning — it sends an executioner."

---

### Graphic Accident Scenes
- Car crash with visible vehicle damage + people
- Slip and fall moment captured
- Workplace accident in progress
- Any "moment of impact" imagery

---

### 🚫 Dashcam / CCTV Footage Format (BANNED)

> **Industry Note:** This is a "gold standard" format in general lead gen, but **NOT compliant for Second Chair.**

**What competitors use:**
- Grainy dashcam footage with timestamps ("REC 09:42 AM")
- Wide-angle CCTV perspective of accidents
- "LIVE" dots and battery icons
- AI-generated synthetic crash footage

**Why it's banned for us:**
- Meta flags as "sensational content" 
- Shows "moment of impact" = exploitation trigger
- Even AI-generated versions trigger same policies
- Creates false urgency that borders on misleading

**The compliant alternative:** Empty intersection photos, aftermath scenes without people, local landmarks known for accidents

---

### 🚫 Settlement Check "Reveal" Videos (BANNED for Video)

> **Industry Note:** "Check reveal" videos are high-performers in the industry, but problematic for compliance.

**What competitors use:**
- POV shot of hand holding check
- Envelope being opened
- Dollar amount visible or blurred
- "Deposit received" celebrations

**Why it's problematic:**
- Implies guaranteed results (compliance violation)
- Creates unrealistic expectations
- Requires disclaimers that kill the emotional hook
- "Sample Result" text doesn't satisfy bar rules in most states

**What we CAN use:** Simple number comparisons ($2,500 → $150,000), abstract settlement references, "Math Problem" format showing the gap

---

## Proceed with Caution (YELLOW Zone)

These may get flagged. Use carefully and monitor CPMs.

### Emergency Imagery
- Emergency vehicle lights (can trigger "sensational")
- Ambulance scenes
- Police at accident scene

**Risk:** May trigger sensational content filter.
**Mitigation:** Lights only, no people, use as distant background.

---

### Medical Equipment
- Wheelchairs (can imply disability = personal attribute)
- Hospital equipment prominently featured
- Medical devices in distressing context

**Risk:** Can trigger healthcare filter even for legal ads.
**Safe alternatives:** Cast with signatures (recovery context), crutches leaning unused.

---

### Money/Cash Imagery
- Stacks of cash
- Money raining down
- "Jackpot" style imagery

**Risk:** Appears scammy, can trigger financial services flags.
**Alternative:** Simple number comparisons or calculator displays.

---

### 🟡 "Bank Deposit Notification" UI Mimicry

**What it is:** Ads styled like smartphone notifications showing "Direct Deposit Received: $25,000"

**Why it's tempting:** Research shows this format "hijacks the dopamine response to notifications" — very high CTR.

**Why it's risky for us:**
- Can be flagged as misleading UI
- Implies guaranteed/specific result
- Platform policies on "deceptive UI elements"
- State bar rules on specific dollar promises

**If using (with extreme caution):**
- Never use specific dollar amounts
- Must be clearly stylized (not exact iOS/Android UI)
- Pair with "potential" or "example" disclaimers
- Monitor CPMs for algorithm flags

---

### 🟡 "Breaking News" / News Chyron Format

**What it is:** Ads styled like news broadcasts with tickers, "BREAKING" banners, red/yellow alert colors

**Why it's tempting:** Borrows authority of news media, bypasses ad skepticism

**Why it's risky:**
- Can trigger "fake news" / misinformation policies
- Platform crackdowns on news mimicry
- Must contain factual, verifiable information only

**If using:**
- Only for mass torts with actual news coverage
- Never fabricate "news" that doesn't exist
- Keep styling clearly differentiated from actual news
- Include clear advertising disclosures

---

### 🟡 AI-Generated "Realistic" Imagery

**The "Uncanny Valley" paradox:** Slight AI artifacts can actually HELP performance by contributing to "amateur" aesthetic. BUT:

**Risks:**
- Obvious AI hands/text = credibility killer
- "Too perfect" faces = stock photo association = distrust
- Platform policies evolving on AI disclosure

**Safe zone for AI:**
- Scenes, backgrounds, documents, objects
- Situations where imperfection is expected (lo-fi)

**Danger zone for AI:**
- Photorealistic faces making claims
- Fake "testimonial" style imagery
- Anything implying real person/real result

---

### 🔴 AI Lip-Sync / Deepfake Video (BANNED)

> **Critical for Jacoby & Meyers compliance:** Meta actively detects AI lip-sync and flags accounts for "Unacceptable Business Practices." This is an account-level ban risk, not just ad rejection.

**What is BANNED:**
- AI-generated video of a person appearing to speak testimonial content
- Lip-sync AI making someone appear to say "I got $50k thanks to..."
- Any video where AI makes it appear a real person is giving a testimonial
- Using image-to-video models to animate faces with speech

**Why this is catastrophic:**
- Meta's detection of synthetic speech is sophisticated and improving
- "Unacceptable Business Practices" = potential permanent account ban
- Jacoby & Meyers as a regulated law firm has zero tolerance for this

**The rule:** Use AI for the VISUALS (scenes, cars, documents, environments), not the EVIDENCE (testimonials, client statements, results claims).

**Safe alternatives:**
- Text overlays on AI-generated visuals
- Voiceover narration over AI scenes (voice doesn't claim to BE the person in video)
- Real spokesperson with AI-generated B-roll backgrounds
- AI generates the setting, human provides the message

## The Quick Test

Before using any image, ask:

| Question | If YES → |
|----------|----------|
| Is there visible injury? | 🔴 RED, do not use |
| Is there human distress? | 🔴 RED, do not use |
| Does it show the accident moment? | 🔴 RED, do not use |
| Could this trigger exploitation flags? | 🔴 RED, do not use |
| Does it show recovery/hope? | ✅ GREEN, safe to use |
| Is it abstract/informational? | ✅ GREEN, safe to use |

---

## The Alternative Approach

For every banned concept, there's a compliant alternative:

| Banned | Alternative |
|--------|-------------|
| Crash footage | Empty intersection, scene without people |
| Person in pain | Person relieved, recovering |
| Hospital distress | Recovery at home, physical therapy |
| Victim imagery | Empowered client getting help |
| Graphic injury | Cast with signatures (positive) |
| Moment of impact | Aftermath with hope framing |

**The principle:** Same emotional story, different chapter.

---

## If Art Director Pushes Back

> **Saul says:** "I get it — 'gritty' is great for Netflix. But this is Meta, and Meta has the content sensitivity of a nervous grandmother. 'Gritty' becomes 'gore' in their eyes real fast."

**The alternative:** Same emotional impact, different visual. Show the recovery, not the trauma.

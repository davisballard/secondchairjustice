## The "Polish Penalty": Why Ugly Ads Win

### The Counter-Intuitive Truth

Industry research consistently shows that high-production-value ads (studio lighting, 4K resolution, professional actors) generate **higher CPMs and lower CTRs** than "ugly" lo-fi ads.

**Data Point:** Case studies show UGC-style iPhone video outperforming $2,000 studio productions by 3:1 in CTR and CPA.

### Why This Happens

| Polish Level | Brain Response | Result |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| High production | "Someone is trying to SELL me" | Defenses UP, scroll past |
| Lo-fi/authentic | "Someone is trying to TELL me" | Defenses DOWN, engagement |

This is "Banner Blindness 2.0" — users have learned to tune out anything that looks like high-end media because it disrupts their native feed experience.

### Visual Characteristics of Winning "Ugly" Ads

| Element | Do This | Not This |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Lighting** | Natural, uneven, shadows, dashboard glow | Three-point studio lighting |
| **Composition** | "Bad" framing, too close, slightly off-center | Perfect rule-of-thirds |
| **Typography** | Platform-native fonts (TikTok/IG story text) | Burnt-in professional subtitles |
| **Quality** | Smartphone-shot texture | 4K cinematic |
| **Setting** | Kitchen table, car interior, office desk | Studio backdrop |

### The "Lo-Fi Trust Signal" in Legal

In the legal vertical specifically, "slick" = "predatory." The "ambulance chaser" stereotype is associated with loud suits and aggressive commercials.

**The reframe:** Lo-fi suggests "budget goes into the settlement, not the advertising."

---

## The Neuroscience of Face Imagery

### Why Faces Matter (Pareidolia)

Humans are evolutionarily hardwired to prioritize faces. In lead gen, the **type** of face and **direction of gaze** are critical variables.

### Authenticity Over Aesthetics

| Face Type | Signal | Performance |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Overly symmetrical, airbrushed | "Stock photo" (deception) | LOW trust, LOW CTR |
| Skin texture, asymmetry, genuine emotion | "Peer" (truth) | HIGH trust, HIGH CTR |
| "Model" face | "This is an ad" | Defenses activated |
| "Lived-in" face (tired, stressed, relieved) | "Someone like me" | Empathy activated |

**The insight:** In PI ads, using faces that look tired, stressed, or relieved **mirrors the emotional state of the accident victim** — creating instant recognition.

### Gaze Cueing (Eye-Tracking Research)

| Gaze Direction | User Behavior | Use For |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Direct at camera | Attention stays on face | Emotional connection, trust-building |
| Looking at text/button | Gaze follows to that element | Directing to CTA |
| "Averted shock" (looking at something off-screen) | Creates curiosity gap | Hook moments |

**High-performing pattern:** Person looking in shock at something (implied settlement amount, document, phone) — viewer's eye follows to the conversion element.

### AI Face Generation Warning

⚠️ **Critical:** AI-generated photorealistic faces are problematic:

- "Too perfect" = stock photo association = distrust
- Uncanny valley effects kill credibility
- Platform policies evolving on AI face disclosure
- Implied testimonial without real person = compliance risk

**Safe alternative:** Use AI for scenes/backgrounds, use stylized or abstract human representation, or wait for real creator partnerships.

---

## The Performance Hierarchy

| Zone | Description | Use |
|------|-------------|-----|
| 🟢 **GREEN** | Safe + High-converting | Default for all ads |
| 🟡 **YELLOW** | Gray area — risky but effective | Test carefully, monitor CPMs |
| 🔴 **RED** | Banned — will get rejected | See `Banned_Imagery.md` |
| ⚫ **DEAD** | Safe but doesn't convert | Avoid — waste of spend |
| 🔮 **FUTURE** | Requires UGC/creators | Deprioritized until we have content creators |

---

## ⚫ DEAD ZONE: What's "Safe" But Kills Performance

> **Behavioral Science:** Generic imagery triggers no psychological response. The brain's pattern-matching says "I've seen this 1000 times" and scrolls past.

### Stop Using These Immediately

| Dead Imagery | Why It Fails | Principle Violated |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| ❌ Stock gavels | Generic, expected, invisible | No pattern interrupt |
| ❌ Scales of justice | Every law firm uses this | Zero distinctiveness |
| ❌ Generic handshakes | Fake, corporate, trust-killing | Authenticity Heuristic |
| ❌ Marble columns & leather books | Signals "expensive, not for me" | Authority without accessibility |
| ❌ Attorney in pristine suit at mahogany desk | Intimidating, unapproachable | Fails empathy test |
| ❌ Corporate headshots with fake smiles | No authenticity | Warranting Theory failure |
| ❌ Award & trophy imagery | Self-congratulatory | Client doesn't care about your awards |
| ❌ Empty conference rooms | Cold, impersonal, dead | No emotional resonance |
| ❌ Over-produced "TV commercial" look | Brain categorizes as ad → defenses UP | Processing Fluency fails |

# 🧠 BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE VISUAL PLAYBOOK

> **Source:** 14 principles from the Behavioral Library, synthesized for visual advertising.
> 
> Each section includes: core mechanism, key studies, visual execution, and AI prompts.

---

## 1. SCARCITY & URGENCY

**Core Mechanism:** People value things more when they're limited in time or quantity. Scarcity bypasses rational evaluation and triggers action.

**Key Studies:**
- Worchel Cookie Jar Study (1975) — Scarce items rated more desirable
- Cialdini's Scarcity Principle (1984) — "Limited time" increases value
- Dynamic Scarcity (Lee & Seidle, 2012) — Real-time depletion increases believability

### Visual Executions

| Format | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| Countdown timer | Deadline urgency |
| Depleting progress bar | Evidence decay, filing windows |
| Calendar with X marks | Days remaining visualization |
| Hourglass | Time metaphor |

**Simplified Countdown:**
```
⏰ TIME REMAINING: 47 days
[Check Your Deadline →]
```

**Evidence Decay Bar:**
```
📹 Security footage: ████░░░░ 30 days left
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Analog clock on desk, legal papers nearby, warm lighting,
11:55 position, sense of urgency, documentary style
```

---

## 2. LOSS AVERSION

**Core Mechanism:** Losses feel 2x more impactful than equivalent gains. People are motivated more by avoiding loss than gaining benefit.

**Key Studies:**
- Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)
- Regret Aversion (Loomes & Sugden, 1982)
- Fear Appeal Theory (Janis & Feshbach, 1953)

### Visual Executions

| Format | Visual Elements |
|--------|-----------------|
| Gap visualization | $2,500 offered → $150,000 actual |
| Before/After | Money left on table |
| Red/Green contrast | Bad outcome vs. good outcome |
| "What you lose" imagery | Empty wallet, rejected check |

**Gap Chart:**
```
Insurance Offer: $2,500
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Actual Value: $150,000
[See What You're Owed →]
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Split image: left side dark and worrying (rejected claim letter),
right side bright and hopeful (settlement check),
high contrast, documentary style
```

---

## 3. SOCIAL PROOF

**Core Mechanism:** People follow the actions of others, especially similar others. "What others do" signals correct behavior.

**Key Studies:**
- Asch Conformity (1951) — People follow group judgment
- Cialdini Hotel Towel Study (2008) — Local norms > generic norms
- Nisbett & Borgida (1975) — One story beats statistics

### Visual Executions

| Format | Visual Elements |
|--------|-----------------|
| Counter display | "2,847 cases reviewed this month" |
| Testimonial layout | Face + quote + location |
| "Others like you" | Regional/demographic imagery |
| Activity indicator | "12 people viewing now" |

**Counter Format:**
```
✓ 2,847 [City] residents reviewed their cases this month
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Diverse group of people in waiting room, candid moment,
some on phones, some talking, warm lighting,
community feeling, NOT stock photo perfection
```

---

## 4. AUTHORITY & CREDIBILITY

**Core Mechanism:** People trust and comply with perceived experts and institutions. Visual authority cues trigger automatic trust.

**Key Studies:**
- Milgram Obedience Study (1963)
- Hovland & Weiss Source Credibility (1951)
- Fogg's Web Credibility (2003)

### Visual Executions

Filing deadlines may apply.
[REQUEST FREE REVIEW]
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Official-looking document on desk, slightly crumpled paper,
CONFIDENTIAL watermark faded, yellow highlighter on key section,
overhead angle, warm office lighting
```

---

## 5. COGNITIVE EASE (Lo-Fi Aesthetic)

**Core Mechanism:** Information that's easy to process feels more true and trustworthy. Polished = ad = defenses up. Lo-fi = authentic = trust.

**Key Studies:**
- Processing Fluency (Reber et al., 1998)
- Song & Schwarz Font Study (2008)
- Oppenheimer's Simplicity Study (2006)

### Visual Executions

┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Notes                              📝  │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ If you were in a car accident          │
│ in [City], read this...                │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Smartphone photo quality, slight motion blur, natural lighting,
imperfect framing, candid moment, NOT studio lighting,
dashboard glow, authentic texture
```

---

## 6. ANCHORING

**Core Mechanism:** First numbers set expectations. The gap between anchor and actual creates perceived value or loss.

**Key Studies:**

| Decoy option | Make middle option attractive |

**Anchor Comparison:**
```
What insurance offered: $2,500
What cases like yours settle for: $85,000 - $150,000
[See Your Estimate →]
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Clean infographic style, large bold numbers, high contrast,
left side small red number, right side large green number,
arrow connecting them, minimal design
```

---

## 7. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY

**Progress Bar:**
```
Your Case Review: ████████░░ 80% Complete
[Finish & Get Results →]
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Close-up of hand checking boxes on form, pen visible,
natural lighting, some boxes already checked,
sense of progress, authentic moment
```

---

## 8. EMOTION & AFFECT

**Core Mechanism:** Feelings drive decisions more than facts. Positive mood = favorable judgment. Specific emotions (anger, fear, hope) trigger specific behaviors.

**Key Studies:**
- Affect Heuristic (Slovic et al., 2002)
- Mood-as-Information (Schwarz & Clore, 1983)
- Bad is Stronger Than Good (Baumeister, 2001)

| Warm lighting | Hope, safety, resolution |
| Before/after emotional | Worry → calm |
| Anger activation | Insurance villain framing |

**Emotional Transition:**
```
[LEFT: Stressed person with paperwork]
[RIGHT: Same person smiling, relaxed]
"From overwhelmed to resolved."
```

**AI Prompt (Before):**
```
Person looking stressed at kitchen table, scattered papers,
dim lighting, worried expression, authentic candid moment
```

**AI Prompt (After):**
```
Same person type smiling, morning coffee, natural light,
relaxed posture, sense of relief, organized space
```

---

## 9. IDENTITY & SELF-SIGNALING

**Core Mechanism:** People choose brands/actions that reinforce who they are or want to be. "People like me do this."

**Key Studies:**
- Self-Perception Theory (Bem, 1972)
- Brand Personality (Aaker, 1997)
- Possible Selves (Oyserman, 2007)

### Visual Executions

| Format | Visual Elements |
|--------|-----------------|
| Demographic mirroring | "People like you" imagery |
| Regional localization | Local landmarks, weather |
| Aspirational identity | Who they could become |
| In-group signals | Cultural, regional, situational |

**Regional Personalization:**
```
⚠️ ATTENTION: California Drivers
[Local highway or landmark in background]
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Person in their 40s, natural appearance, slight imperfections,
regional Pacific Northwest look, authentic expression,
NOT model, relatable everyday person
```

---

## 10. CHOICE ARCHITECTURE

**Core Mechanism:** How options are presented affects decisions. Fewer choices = more action. Clear CTAs = higher conversion.

**Key Studies:**
- Jam Study (Iyengar & Lepper, 2000) — 6 options > 24
- Decoy Effect (Huber et al., 1982)
- Default Effect (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008)

|--------|-----------------|
| Single CTA focus | One clear action |
| Comparison table | Make one option obviously better |
| Benefit highlighting | Green checks vs. red X |
| Reduced clutter | Remove navigation, distractions |

**Comparison Table:**
```
WITHOUT LEGAL HELP     │    WITH LEGAL HELP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┼━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ Accept first offer   │  ✅ Negotiate full value
❌ Navigate alone       │  ✅ Expert guidance
❌ Miss deadlines       │  ✅ Protected rights
```

---

## 11. MEMORY & PRIMING

**Core Mechanism:** Prior exposure influences current perception. Contextual cues trigger associated memories and behaviors.

**Key Studies:**
- Mere Exposure Effect (Zajonc, 1968)
- Contextual Memory (Godden & Baddeley, 1975)
- Priming and Behavior (Bargh et al., 1996)

### Visual Executions

|--------|-----------------|
| Consistent branding | Same colors, fonts, elements |
| Context matching | Show environment user will act in |
| Retrieval cues | Specific visual triggers |
| Repetition | Brand elements across touchpoints |

**Context Matching (for MVA):**
```
Car interior shot, dashboard visible, driver's perspective,
familiar commute feeling, relatable context
```

---

## 12. TIME & DELAY MOTIVATION

**Core Mechanism:** People prefer immediate rewards over delayed ones. Near future feels concrete; far future feels abstract.

**Key Studies:**
- Hyperbolic Discounting (Laibson, 1997)
- Construal Level Theory (Trope & Liberman, 2003)
- Hot-Cold Empathy Gap (Loewenstein, 1996)

### Visual Executions

| Format | Visual Elements |
|--------|-----------------|
| "Now" framing | Immediate action emphasis |
| Concrete near-future | Specific dates, not vague timeframes |
| Small unit framing | "30 days" not "1 month" |
| Instant gratification | "Results in 2 minutes" |

**Near-Future Concreteness:**
```
Your deadline: January 28, 2025
(That's only 14 days away)
[Start Now →]
```

---

## 13. CURIOSITY GAP

## The "Car Rant" Simulation

**What Real Creators Do:** Attorney or victim sits in driver's seat, speaks directly to camera, reveals insider information with authentic frustration/passion.

### AI Simulation Approach

Generate still images that capture the "car rant" aesthetic:
- Person in driver's seat, dashboard visible
- Phone mounted on dashboard (selfie angle)
- Natural car interior lighting
- Expression: passionate, concerned, revealing

**AI Prompt:**
```
Person sitting in car driver seat, looking at phone camera mounted on dashboard,
speaking passionately, concerned expression, daytime natural lighting through windows,

---

## The "Green Screen Commentary" Simulation

**What Real Creators Do:** Use platform Green Screen effect with news article, document, or statistic as background while speaking to camera.

### AI Simulation Approach

Create split-composition images:
- Person in foreground (shoulders/head)
- Document/statistic/news as background
- "Pointing at" or "reacting to" the information

**AI Prompt:**
```
Person pointing at camera with concerned expression, 
green screen style with blurred document visible behind them,
screenshot from video appearance, casual clothing,
authentic influencer content aesthetic, NOT polished,
TikTok/Instagram Reel style, natural expressions
```

### Static Version for Ads
```

│  [INSURANCE DOCUMENT BACKGROUND]    │
│                                     │
│         👆                          │
│    "Did you see this?"              │
│                                     │
│    Insurance adjusters are          │
│    trained to say THIS...           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## The "Testimonial Style" Simulation

**What Real Creators Do:** Client shares their story — what happened, how bad it was, how it got resolved.

### AI Simulation Approach

Generate "interview moment" stills:
- Person in home setting
- Visible injury recovery (cast, brace, sling)
- Natural lighting, authentic environment
- Expression: reflective, grateful, relieved

**AI Prompt:**
```
Person with arm in sling sitting on couch at home,
speaking to someone off-camera, natural window lighting,
authentic living room setting, family photos in background,
recovery context, hopeful expression, candid interview moment,
NOT stock photo, smartphone video screenshot quality
```

---

## The "POV Victim" Format

**What Real Creators Do:** First-person perspective of the accident aftermath — looking at damage, hands shaking, calling for help.

### AI Simulation Approach

Generate first-person perspective images:
- POV looking at car damage
- Hands visible in frame
- Dashboard/steering wheel perspective
- Roadside setting

**AI Prompt (POV at accident scene):**
```
First person POV looking at damaged car bumper,
person's hands visible in frame inspecting dent,
roadside setting, natural daylight, 
authentic smartphone photo quality, slight blur,
aftermath feeling, NOT staged, genuine moment
```

**AI Prompt (POV inside car):**
```
First person POV from driver seat looking at cracked windshield,
hands on steering wheel visible, dashboard visible,
accident aftermath feeling, natural lighting,
smartphone camera quality, authentic moment
```

---

## The "Before/After Recovery" Format

| Hospital/roadside setting | Home, back to life |
| Medical equipment visible | Healed, moving forward |

**AI Prompt (Before):**
```
Person looking stressed and exhausted in hospital waiting room,
wearing casual clothes, worried expression, 
fluorescent lighting, authentic candid moment,
NOT dramatic, subtle distress, smartphone quality
```

**AI Prompt (After):**
```
Same person type smiling while walking outside,
sunny day, casual clothing, sense of relief,
life back to normal feeling, authentic candid moment,
smartphone photo quality, genuine happiness
```

---

## The "Shaky Cam / Motion" Simulation

> **Danny's insight:** "Look how good my click-through rate is, it's performing 900% greater than average. I think it's because I have a hot shake in there."

### Why Motion/Shake Works
- **Pattern interrupt** — stands out in static feed
- **Authenticity signal** — imperfection = real
- **Attention capture** — movement draws the eye

### For Static Ads (Simulating Motion)
- Add slight motion blur to images
- Use diagonal compositions
- Create "caught mid-action" moments

**AI Prompt:**
```
Slightly blurry action shot of person inspecting car damage,
motion blur effect, candid caught-in-the-moment feeling,
natural lighting, authentic accident aftermath,
smartphone video screenshot quality, dynamic composition
```

### For Video Ads
- Add digital shake effect in post
- Use handheld camera simulation
- Keep movement subtle but noticeable

---

## The "Atypical Face" Strategy

> **From Danny's meeting:** "They respond best to atypical faces... something that's not like perfect... I'm interested to be like all right what is an attractive woman in Seattle look like but make her like you know a little bit imperfect."

### Why Imperfect Faces Work
| Perfect Face | Atypical Face |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Stock photo" association | "Real person" association |
| Distrust triggered | Trust activated |
| Invisible (pattern matched) | Noticed (novelty) |

### AI Generation Guidelines

**DO prompt for:**
- Natural skin texture
- Slight asymmetry
- Tired/stressed/relieved expressions
- Age-appropriate features (35-55 for MVA)
- Regional appearance diversity

**DO NOT prompt for:**
- Model-perfect features
- Heavy makeup/styling
- Unnaturally smooth skin
- "Stock photo smile"

**AI Prompt Example:**
```
Candid portrait of 42-year-old woman with natural appearance,
slight imperfections, tired but hopeful expression,
natural lighting, authentic moment, no makeup visible,
real person feeling, NOT model, NOT stock photo,
regional Pacific Northwest appearance
```

## 4. The "Personalized Alert" Format ⭐⭐⭐

**What it is:** Ads styled as personalized alerts addressed to specific situations or locations.

### Why It Works (Behavioral Science)

| Principle | Study | Application |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Cocktail Party Effect** | Treisman's Attenuation Model (1964) | We notice information relevant to us |
| **Local Social Proof** | Cialdini Hotel Towel Study (2008) | "People in THIS area" > generic messaging |

├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ✅ FACT                              │

│ upfront. You only pay if you win.   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 10. The "News Ticker / Headlines" Format ⭐⭐

**What it is:** Ads styled as breaking news headlines or ticker updates.

### Why It Works (Behavioral Science)

| Principle | Study | Application |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Authority Through Medium** | News format implies importance |
| **Mere Exposure** | Familiar format = trusted format |
| **Urgency Through Recency** | "Breaking" implies time-sensitivity |

### Visual Execution

```

---

## 11. The "Enemy Exposed" Format ⭐ (Test Carefully)

**What it is:** Images positioning insurance companies as the antagonist — showing their tactics or practices.

### Why It Works (Behavioral Science)

| Principle | Study | Application |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **In-group/Out-group** | Tajfel's Social Identity Theory (1979) | "Us vs. them" activates tribal instincts |
| **Moral Disgust** | Rozin, Haidt & McCauley (2000) | Unfairness triggers action |
| **Anger = Approach** | Harmon-Jones (2004) | Unlike fear, anger drives toward action |

### Visual Execution

**Option A: The Reveal**
```
What insurance adjusters are trained to do:

☑️ Delay your claim
☑️ Deny first, ask questions later  
☑️ Offer lowest possible settlement
☑️ Hope you give up

[Level the playing field →]
```

**Option B: The Split**
```
┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐
│ What They   │   │ What They   │
│ SAY         │   │ MEAN        │
├─────────────┤   ├─────────────┤
│ "We'll take │   │ "We'll delay│
│ care of you"│   │ until you   │
│             │   │ give up"    │
└─────────────┘   └─────────────┘
```

### ⚠️ Compliance Note
Do NOT use actual insurance company logos or names. Keep messaging factual, not defamatory. Monitor for platform flags.

# 🟢 TIER 2: AI-Assisted Imagery (Candid Photography)

These formats use AI-generated "candid" style photography.

---

## 12. The "War Room" Shot

hopeful optimistic expression, life moving forward feeling,
not stock photo, authentic candid moment
```

---

## 14. The "Before/After Transformation" (Emotional)

**What it is:** Split imagery showing emotional state before contact vs. after — without showing injury.

### Visual Execution

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Stressed, worried expression | Relieved, hopeful expression |
| Messy desk with bills | Organized, calm environment |
| Isolation | Connection with family |

**AI Prompt for "Before":**
```
Person looking stressed and overwhelmed, sitting at kitchen table
with scattered paperwork and unopened mail, dim lighting,
worried expression, authentic candid moment, not exaggerated

**AI Prompt:**
```
[City name] [street/intersection], daytime, clear documentary style,
traffic lights and street signs visible, urban environment,
realistic lighting, journalistic photography aesthetic,
establishing shot, no people prominently featured
```

# 🔮 FUTURE: Full UGC/Creator Content (When Available)

These formats require real people creating actual video content. **Use AI simulations (above) to test concepts now.**

---

## Video Formats (Need Real Creators)

### The "Car Rant" Video
- Attorney or actor in driver's seat
- Speaking directly to camera, passionate delivery
- Reveals "insider secret" about insurance tactics
- **AI Simulation:** ✅ Use static "car rant" imagery above
- **Full Version:** Waiting for creator network

### Green Screen Commentary Video
- Native platform Green Screen effect
- Background: news article, statistic, insurance document
- Speaker guides attention with gestures
- **AI Simulation:** ✅ Use split-composition stills above
- **Full Version:** Waiting for creator network

### Dual Creator Q&A Format
- One person asks naive question
- Other corrects with authority
- **AI Simulation:** ❌ Difficult to simulate
- **Full Version:** Waiting for creator network

### The Viral Stitch/Duet
- React to dashcam footage (non-graphic)
- Comment on news clips
- **AI Simulation:** ❌ Requires real video
- **Full Version:** Waiting for creator network

---

## Testimonial Formats (Need Real Clients)

### Real Client Testimonials
- Actual client speaking about experience
- Recovery-focused, not injury-focused
- **AI Simulation:** ✅ Use "testimonial style" stills above
- **Full Version:** Need partner firm cooperation

### Video Testimonials
- Client on camera discussing process
- Emotional resolution story
- **AI Simulation:** ✅ Partial — use interview stills
- **Full Version:** Need partner firm cooperation

---

## Social Proof (Need Real Data)

### Social Proof Counter (When Available)
- "$425,000,000+ Recovered"
- "10,547 Cases Reviewed"
- **Status:** Need accurate data from partner firms
- **Note:** Cannot use these without verified data — compliance risk

---

## Creator Types to Recruit (Future)

When scaling to real UGC, target these creator profiles:

| Creator Type | Content Style | Cost Range |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| Regional micro-influencer | Car rant, local flavor | $200-500/video |
| Actor (SAG/non-union) | Scripted testimonial style | $500-1500/day |
| Real MVA survivors | Authentic testimonial | Gift/payment + release |
| Legal TikTokers | Educational, myth-busting | $500-2000/video |

### Danny's Scaling Philosophy
> "My plan is to scale using the lowest cost resources which is AI... once we have bigger revenue pipeline then we can start to justify the expense of shooting our own actors."

**Current Phase:** AI simulation → test concepts → identify winners
**Future Phase:** Real actors → shoot proven concepts → scale

# 🟡 YELLOW ZONE: Gray Area (Test Carefully)

These can get flagged but often don't — and they convert when they run.

| Format | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Emergency Lights | MEDIUM-LOW | Lights only, no people |
| Medical Equipment (Recovery) | LOW-MEDIUM | Casts with signatures = safer |
| Settlement Check | LOW-MEDIUM | Anonymize, add disclaimer |
| "Before Moment" Scenes | LOW | Empty scene, no people |
| News Clip Aesthetic | LOW | Include "Advertisement" |
| Dashcam (No People) | MEDIUM | Use as background only |

---

# Production Priority Matrix

Based on what we can create NOW with AI + templates:

| Priority | Format | Effort | Impact | Frequency |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **1** | Math Problem / Gap Visual | Very Low | Very High | Daily |
| **2** | Quote Card | Very Low | High | Daily |
| **3** | Comparison Table | Low | Very High | 3x/week |
| **4** | Personalized Alert | Low | Very High | Per geo-campaign |
| **5** | Counter-Narrative (Myth/Fact) | Low | High | 3x/week |
| **6** | Warning Label | Low | High | As needed |
| **7** | Government Form / Notice | Low | High | Mass tort, deadlines |
| **8** | Found Document | Medium | Very High | Test carefully |
| **9** | Timeline/Journey | Medium | Medium-High | Landing pages |
| **10** | News Ticker | Medium | Medium | Awareness |
| **11** | Enemy Exposed | Medium | High | Monitor compliance |

# Platform-Specific Visual Architecture

> **Source:** Industry research on platform-specific performance (2025-2026)

## Meta Feed (Facebook/Instagram)

Meta's feed is a high-velocity stream. The visual goal is to **arrest momentum.**

| Format | Best For | CTR Benchmark |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Math Problem | Cold traffic | High (2.0-3.5%) |
| Comparison Table | Consideration | High (2.0-3.0%) |
| Quote Card | Retargeting | Medium (1.5-2.5%) |
| Personalized Alert | Geo-targeted | Very High (2.5-4.0%) |
| Candid AI Photography | General awareness | Medium (1.0-2.0%) |

### The "Notes App" Format ⭐⭐⭐ (Instagram Specific)

**What it is:** A screenshot of the iPhone "Notes" app containing plain text message.

**Example:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Notes                              📝  │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                        │
│ If you were in a car accident          │
│ in [City], read this...                │
│                                        │
│ Most people don't know that            │
│ insurance companies...                 │
│                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it works:**
- Feels personal (like a private memo shared publicly)
- Anti-design = pattern interrupt
- Forces user to READ because it looks like leaked content
- Platform-native aesthetic

### Creative Fatigue Mitigation

Meta's algorithm burns through creative rapidly. Unbranded strategies mitigate this through "iterative variety":

- Same script on 50 different backgrounds
- Rotate: car interior, office desk, walking outside, kitchen table
- This visual volume sustains performance across weeks

---

## Google Display

Unlike social, Google Display requires **trust bridges** — users are in research mode on reputable sites.

| Format | Best For | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Government Form | Mass tort | Authority borrowing |
| Warning Label | Deadline urgency | Pattern interrupt |
| Math Problem | Value proposition | Clear, simple |
| Trust-Badged Clean | General | Include BBB, verified signals |

**Key difference:** "Ugly ads" can look suspicious on news sites. Google Display often requires visible trust badges (BBB, 5 Stars, "Verified") to bridge credibility gap.

---

## YouTube

Google users often have higher intent (actively searching for solutions).

| Placement | Key Visual Requirement |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Pre-roll (Skippable) | Hook in first 5 seconds |
| Shorts | Match TikTok aesthetic |
| Discovery | Thumbnail must create curiosity gap |

**Effective hook structure:** "Did you know?" format with speaker pointing to text asking a qualifying question.

---

## TikTok / Reels ⏸️ (When We Have Creators)

TikTok is the most hostile environment for traditional ads. Ads are actively punished by algorithm if engagement is low.

**Key Requirements:**
- Visual cuts every 1.5-3 seconds (static talking heads fail)
- Platform-native effects (Green Screen, text stickers)
- Ride trending sounds and visual formats
- Information-dense to match dopamine cadence

| Format | Best For | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Car Rant | Cold traffic | ⏸️ Needs creator |
| Green Screen | Education | ⏸️ Needs creator |
| Stitch/Duet | Viral potential | ⏸️ Needs creator |
| Dual Creator | Objection handling | ⏸️ Needs creator |

# AI Prompting Guide: "Amateur" Realism

> **The paradox:** Slight AI artifacts can actually HELP performance by contributing to the "amateur" aesthetic. As long as the emotional focal point is clear, imperfections validate "realness."

## Prompt Engineering for Lo-Fi Authenticity

### Keywords That Create "Ugly" Aesthetic
Use these to avoid the AI "polish penalty":
- `low resolution`, `motion blur`, `bad lighting`
- `camera flash`, `grainy`, `iPhone photo`
- `candid moment`, `not posing`, `authentic`
- `messy background`, `natural lighting`
- `documentary style`, `raw`, `unedited`

### Negative Prompts (What to Avoid)
Add these to your negative prompts:
- `studio lighting`, `perfect composition`
- `professional lighting`, `4k`, `cinematic`
- `rendered`, `3d`, `clean`, `polished`
- `stock photo`, `watermark`
- `advertising style`, `commercial`

## Compliant Prompt Templates by Format

```
Official-looking insurance document on desk, paper slightly crumpled,
yellow highlighter marking key section, warm office lighting,
documentary photography style, overhead angle, shallow depth of field,
some text visible but not fully readable, authentic office setting,

```

### For "War Room" / Attorney Working
```
Professional attorney in business casual, sleeves rolled up, 
working late at desk with papers scattered, warm office lighting, 
candid moment, tired but determined expression, not posing for camera,

```

### For "Local Scene" / Intersection
```
[City name] street intersection, daytime, documentary photography style,
traffic lights and street signs visible, urban environment,
realistic weather, journalistic aesthetic, establishing shot,
no people prominently featured, NOT polished, real-world imperfections
```

### For "Stressed to Relieved" Before/After
**Before:**
```
Person looking stressed, sitting at kitchen table with scattered 
paperwork and unopened mail, dim natural lighting, worried expression,
authentic candid moment, NOT exaggerated, subtle stress cues
```

**After:**
```
Same person smiling with morning coffee, natural window light,
relaxed posture, organized space, sense of relief and calm,
authentic moment, NOT stock photo happiness
```

## ⚠️ BANNED Prompt Concepts (Never Use)

Even with AI generation, these will get flagged or violate compliance:

| Concept | Why Banned | Alternative |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `dashcam footage`, `CCTV`, `crash footage` | Sensational content policy | Empty intersection, aftermath |
| `car accident`, `collision`, `impact` | Shows moment of trauma | Pulled-over car, tow truck |
| `crying`, `distressed`, `in pain` | Exploitation flags | Concerned, then relieved |
| `hospital bed`, `emergency room` | Medical/health triggers | Recovery at home, physical therapy |
| `check`, `deposit`, `settlement amount` | Implies guaranteed results | Abstract number comparisons |
| `blood`, `injury`, `wound` | Always rejected | Cast with signatures, recovery |

---

# Quick Decision Framework

Before using any image:

1. ❓ **Does it look like every other law firm ad?** → DON'T USE (⚫ Dead)
2. ❓ **Does it show injury, blood, or distress?** → DON'T USE (🔴 Red)
3. ❓ **Does it activate a behavioral principle?** → More principles = more effective
4. ❓ **Can we make this with AI/templates right now?** → Prioritize these
5. ❓ **Does it require real people/testimonials?** → Save for future (🔮)
6. ❓ **Would this stop YOUR scroll?** → If no, find something better

# Behavioral Science Quick Reference

| Principle | What It Means | How We Use It |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Loss Aversion** | Losses feel 2x as impactful as gains | Show money left on table |
| **Anchoring** | First number sets expectations | Show low offer vs actual value |
| **Social Proof** | People follow others | Show others getting help |
| **Authority** | We trust experts/institutions | Government form aesthetic |
| **Curiosity Gap** | Brain craves completion | Found document, partial reveals |
| **Cognitive Ease** | Easy = true | Simple designs, clear messaging |
| **Reactance** | "Hidden" info = must access | Leaked/exposed framing |
| **Fear + Efficacy** | Fear works WITH solution | Warning + clear CTA |
| **Scarcity/Urgency** | Limited = valuable | Ticking clocks, countdown timers |
| **Temporal Discounting** | Near deadlines feel real | "30 days" beats "2 years" |

# 🚗 MVA-SPECIFIC IMAGERY GUIDELINES

> **Reminder:** Second Chair focuses exclusively on Motor Vehicle Accidents. All imagery must relate to car, motorcycle, truck, or rideshare accidents.

## Approved MVA Contexts

| Context | Visual Elements | Use For |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Accident Aftermath** | Dented bumper, cracked windshield, tow truck, roadside | Pattern interrupt, relevance |
| **Inside the Car** | Dashboard, steering wheel, POV from seat | Car rant style, authenticity |
| **Recovery** | Arm in sling, neck brace, physical therapy | Empathy, hope |
| **Insurance Battle** | Paperwork, phone calls, frustrated expressions | Problem awareness |
| **Legal Help** | Attorney meeting, document signing, consultation | Solution framing |

## NOT Approved (Out of Scope)

| Category | Why Excluded |
|----------|--------------|
| Workplace injuries | Not MVA — different niche |
| Slip and fall | Not MVA — different niche |
| Medical settings (pre-accident) | Not MVA-related |
| Mass tort products | Not MVA — different campaigns |
| Construction sites | Not MVA — workplace niche |

# 🎬 QUICK REFERENCE: VISUAL EXECUTION DETAILS

> **Note:** For full behavioral science breakdowns, see the **Behavioral Science Visual Playbook** at the top of this document.

## Color Psychology Quick Reference

| Color | Psychological Trigger | Use For |
|-------|----------------------|---------|
| **Red** | Danger, urgency, loss aversion | Deadlines, what they'll LOSE |
| **Green** | Safety, gains, money, success | Solutions, what they'll GAIN |
| **Yellow** | Caution, attention | Alerts, warnings |
| **Blue** | Trust, calm, authority | Trust signals, legal credibility |

---

## Number Psychology

**Specific Numbers > Round Numbers** (Anchoring Principle)
- "$147,500" feels more real than "$150,000"
- "47 days" beats "about 2 months"
- Specificity = credibility signal

**The Contrast Effect** (Loss Aversion)
- Insurance offer: $2,500 → Actual value: $150,000
- Show the GAP to activate loss aversion

---

## Motion & Animation

**The "Shake" Effect** (Pattern Interrupt)
> **Danny:** "900% above average CTR" — motion breaks scroll pattern

- Add subtle shake to video
- Use motion blur in stills
- "Caught mid-action" compositions

**Pulsing/Blinking** (Urgency)
- Pulsing CTA buttons
- Blinking warning indicators
- Animated countdown digits

## ⚠️ THE SECRET SAUCE: CHARACTER-AS-INSIGHT

### Why This Format Works

Luca's characters make you go **"No fucking way. That is EXACTLY that person."**

Every character — villain insurance executive, hero accident victim — is built with **starter pack precision**. Not "a business man" but THE insurance villain where every single detail screams recognition. Not "a working mom" but THE exact working-class family archetype for your target market.

**The character IS the insight.** Before a word is spoken, you know exactly who this person is, what they believe, what their problems are.

### Starter Pack Precision (Observant, Not Derogatory)

This isn't mockery. It's **paying homage by nailing every detail.** Like a great portrait artist who captures essence, we capture cultural archetypes with such precision that viewers feel seen.

| Generic AI Prompt | Luca Maxim Level |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "Insurance executive in suit" | 58-year-old with silver hair slicked back with too much gel, soft jowly face, gold wire-frame glasses, charcoal pinstripe three-piece suit, burgundy silk tie with gold tie pin, Rolex visible, signet ring on pinky, expression of amused contempt, the face of a man who denies claims before breakfast |
| "Working mom at home" | 40-year-old Latina, dark hair in loose ponytail with pieces falling out, worn heather grey hoodie, small gold stud earrings (sentimental), brown sectional couch with kids' toys, family photos on wall, Virgin Mary candle, palm tree through window, Chihuahua mix beside her |

**The difference**: One is forgettable. The other is unforgettable because you KNOW that person.

### The Full Character Sheet Method

Every significant character needs a complete breakdown before prompting:

| Category | What to Define | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Demographics** | Age (specific decade), ethnicity, body type | Archetype foundation |
| **Face** | Specific features, weathering, expression default | Recognition trigger |
| **Hair** | Style, color, condition — what it says about them | Class/lifestyle marker |
| **Clothing (Every Item)** | Top, layer, bottom, shoes — brand-level specific | Identity uniform |
| **Accessories** | Watch, jewelry, glasses — class/identity markers | Economic reality |
| **Props** | What's in their hands? What objects define them? | Story objects |
| **Environment** | Every background detail — what's on shelves, walls, floor | World-building |
| **Psychological State** | What are they feeling? What's their arc? | Emotional journey |
| **Expression Range** | How does their face move through the piece? | Performance direction |
| **Easter Eggs** | Small details that reward close viewing | Engagement drivers |

### Villain vs. Hero: Both Get Full Treatment

**THE VILLAIN (Insurance Executive)** — Cartoonishly, archetypally evil:
- The suit that's too perfect, too expensive
- The accessories that scream wealth without soul (gold everything)
- The expression of amused contempt
- The environment that shows power (massive desk, city view, victim-as-trinket)
- Props that visualize cruelty (the miniature victim in the paperweight, the worn "DENIED" stamp)

**THE HERO (Accident Victim)** — Recognizably "us":
- The clothes that show they work for a living (worn, practical, not new)
- The accessories that are sentimental, not flashy (small gold studs, thin chain)
- The environment that shows their real life (clutter, family, warmth)
- The expression arc from exhaustion to determination to hope
- Small details that show they're the center of a family (kids' art, toys, photos)

### The "I Know That Person" Test

Before generating ANY character, ask:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Recognition** | Would the target audience say "that's my neighbor / my sister / my boss"? |
| **Specificity** | Are there at least 10 specific visual details defined? |
| **Archetype** | What "starter pack" is this character from? |
| **Class Markers** | Do accessories and environment show economic reality? |
| **Emotional State** | Is the expression arc defined for every beat? |
| **No Generic Details** | Have I replaced every "a suit" with "charcoal pinstripe with burgundy tie"? |
| **Market-Specific** | Does this BLEED the target state/market? |

## ⚠️ MOTION & ENERGY: EVERYTHING IS DRAMATIC

### Nothing Is Subtle. Nothing Is Slow.

Luca's videos are ALIVE. Every action is performed with maximum dramatic energy. The emotion dial is set to 10.

| Wrong (Generic AI) | Right (Luca Maxim) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| "Slowly reaches for stamp" | "SLAMS stamp down hard and fast, repeatedly, with force" |
| "Subtle handheld movement" | "Chaotic motion, people laughing, pointing, animated" |
| "Gently picks up document" | "Snatches document, waves it, points aggressively" |
| "Calm office scene" | "Cackling lawyers, table-slapping, high energy chaos" |
| "Subject stands still" | "Subject is the eye of the storm OR the source of dramatic action" |

### The Center Subject Rule

**Option A: The Still Eye of the Storm**
- Everyone AROUND them is in chaotic motion — laughing, pointing, slapping table
- The center subject remains composed, watching with quiet satisfaction  
- The CONTRAST between stillness and chaos = power

**Option B: The Source of Drama**
- The subject IS the action — slamming, gesturing, performing
- Motion is big, theatrical, exaggerated
- Nothing subtle — every movement is a PERFORMANCE

### Motion Energy Principles

**Group Shots — Staggered Natural Movement:**
- People should NOT move in synchronized unison — that looks robotic
- Movements should RIPPLE through the group at staggered moments
- Use timing cues: "FIRST... A BEAT LATER... THEN... MEANWHILE..."
- Each person moves at their OWN moment, their OWN rhythm
- The energy flows organically, not mechanically

**The Still Center Rule:**
- When one subject is the focus, they can remain STILL while chaos surrounds them
- The contrast between stillness and surrounding motion = POWER
- The still subject is the eye of the storm, the king watching his machine

**Solo Action — Maximum Force:**
- Actions are FAST, HARD, DECISIVE — never gentle or slow
- Repeated actions escalate in intensity (slam, SLAM, SLAM HARDER)
- Physical impact should be visible (papers shift, things ripple)
- The violence/force of action tells the emotional story

**Camera Movement — Dynamic, Not Passive:**
- Cameras SWEEP, ARC, PUSH, DIVE — never just "slowly pan"
- Match camera energy to scene energy
- The camera has PURPOSE and DIRECTION, not just observation
- Faster camera = more dramatic energy

### The Emotion Dial = 10/10

| Action | Low Energy (Wrong) | High Energy (Luca Maxim) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Laughing** | Slight smile | Mouth WIDE open, head thrown back, belly laugh |
| **Pointing** | Gesturing vaguely | Jabbing finger aggressively |
| **Denying Claims** | Stamping once | SLAMMING stamp repeatedly, rapid fire until paper tears |
| **Scheming** | Looking at papers | Huddle, whisper, break into cackling |
| **Contempt** | Slight smirk | Sneer, eye roll, dismissive wave |
| **Support** | Standing nearby | Hand on shoulder with FIRM reassuring grip |
| **Celebration** | Arms raised | Arms THRUST skyward, cheering, embracing |

### Timing & Pacing

**Action Placement:**
- If an action should trigger a response (button tap, etc.), place it at the END of the clip
- The video ends on the action — the response is implied by the cut
- Build anticipation in the first 80% of the clip, action in the final 20%

**Static Elements in Animation:**
- When screens, text, or documents must stay readable, mark them as FROZEN/STATIC
- Only the real-world elements (hands, camera, environment) should move
- Explicitly state "do NOT animate" for elements that must stay unchanged

**If your Kling prompt doesn't have dynamic verbs and energy descriptors — it's too subtle.**

## THE CORE RULE: NO BORING SHOTS

Every frame must feel like it could be a movie poster.

Before generating ANY shot, ask:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Emotional Weight** | Does this frame have tension, revelation, absurdity, or drama? |
| **Screenshot Test** | Would someone screenshot this? |
| **Visual Contrast** | Is there power dynamics, scale contrast, or lighting contrast? |
| **Camera Meaning** | Does the camera movement add emotional meaning? |
| **Character Depth** | Is this character built with full starter-pack precision? |

**If the answer is "no" to any of these, redesign the shot.**

### The Luca Maxim Difference

| Traditional Ad | Luca Maxim Style |
|----------------|------------------|
| Establishing shot of building | God view: exec looking down at miniature victim |
| Person reading document | Close-up: eyes scanning, jaw clenching, harsh fluorescent light |
| Office workers | Kafkaesque: identical adjusters in rows, typing in unison |
| Person with lawyer | Hero shot: golden hour, documents in hand, agency reclaimed |
| "A business man" | THE insurance villain with every evil detail |
| "A working mom" | THE working-class archetype for your market who handles everything |

**The mundane made dramatic.** A settlement letter becomes a reveal. A waiting room becomes oppression. An insurance office becomes a machine. And the characters are so specific they're insights themselves.

## SHOT TYPE STRATEGIES

### Army/Group Shots
When showing groups of people (villain teams, hero teams, crowds):
- The group should SURROUND and FRAME the central subject/family
- Each person in the group needs distinct action/expression — not clones
- Create a protective formation (heroes) or threatening formation (villains)
- The MORE people you add, the more power is conveyed
- Groups should have visible diversity (age, ethnicity, gender, role)
- Stagger their movements so they don't look like synchronized robots

### Power Contrast Shots
Every hero shot should CONTRAST with the villain shots:

| Villain Element | Hero Contrast |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Cold fluorescent lighting | Warm golden hour light |
| Sterile glass/steel | Warm wood/leather |
| Looking DOWN at victims | Standing WITH/around family |
| Identical grey suits | Diverse, individual but unified |
| Empty soulless office | Awards, family photos, warmth |
| Gold flashy accessories | Understated, quality |
| Denial stamps everywhere | Victory headlines, "WON" files |
| Cackling contempt | Fierce protective determination |

### Scale Shots (Stadiums, Crowds, Masses)
When showing massive scale (100,000 people, etc.):
- Use real landmarks from the target market without specific branding
- Golden hour light makes crowds feel warm and triumphant
- Include the key number/message ON THE FIELD or center of the space
- The crowd IS the proof — every seat filled
- Diversity reflects demographics of the target market
- Balance dramatic energy with photorealistic grounding — avoid looking "too AI"
- Let the SCALE speak rather than adding excessive confetti/fireworks

### Absurdist Object Shots
For shots that reveal truth through a single detail:
- The object should be hyperrealistic, almost documentary style
- It tells the WHOLE story in one visual (worn stamp = millions of denials)
- Place it in mundane context that makes the implication more horrifying
- The camera "discovers" it like a documentary finding evidence
- The villain's hand should be reaching for or actively using the object

### CTA/Action Shots
For the final call-to-action:
- Over-the-shoulder framing puts viewer in the subject's position
- The phone/screen takes up majority of frame for visibility
- Keep screen content STATIC and readable — no animation on text
- The decisive action (tap, click) happens at the END of the clip
- Build anticipation through the shot, payoff in final moment
- Warm lighting from hero scenes carries through to CTA

---

## ENVIRONMENT STRATEGIES

### Villain Environments
- Cold, harsh, institutional lighting (fluorescent, blue tint)
- Glass, steel, grey tones — no warmth anywhere
- Oversized furniture showing power and compensation
- No personal touches — sterile, corporate, soulless
- Floor-to-ceiling windows showing they're ABOVE everyone
- Visible evidence of denial (stamps, files, lowball numbers crossed out)
- Props that visualize cruelty (miniature victims, worn deny stamps)

### Hero Environments
- Warm, golden, natural lighting (golden hour)
- Wood paneling, leather furniture, burgundy/navy tones
- Professional but WELCOMING — success with humanity
- Success markers that prove RESULTS (verdict headlines, recovered amounts)
- Personal touches (family photos, client victory photos, fresh flowers)
- Market-specific markers (state flag, local landscape through window, regional pride)
- Awards showing COMPETENCE not just wealth

### Camera Movement Philosophy
- Cameras SWEEP, ARC, PUSH, DIVE — never just "slowly pan"
- Match camera energy to scene energy
- The camera has PURPOSE and DIRECTION, not passive observation
- Dynamic movement through space, not static observation
- Faster camera = more dramatic energy

## WHEN TO USE THIS FORMAT

| Use For | Don't Use For |
|---------|---------------|
| Premium brand-building ads | Quick-turn performance testing |
| Emotional settlement gap angles | Simple "check eligibility" direct response |
| Satirizing insurance industry | Motion Still (5-6s) content |
| Pattern interrupts that stop scroll | UGC/lo-fi aesthetic campaigns |

**This format is expensive** (~$2-3 per video). Use for hero content and high-value placements.

## VISUAL CONTRAST TECHNIQUES

### Power Dynamics

| Subject | Visual Treatment |
|---------|------------------|
| Insurance company | God view, looking down, dark suits, cold lighting |
| Victim (before) | Low angle looking up, harsh fluorescent, cramped |
| Victim (after) | Eye level or slight low angle, warm light, space |
| Lawyer | Equal footing with victim, warm light, professional |

### Scale Contrast

| To Show | Visual Technique |
|---------|------------------|
| Victim powerlessness | Miniature/snow globe, wide shot showing isolation |
| Corporate machine | Rows of identical workers, endless cubicles |
| Hope/resolution | Single subject in frame with room to breathe |

### Lighting Contrast

| Scene | Lighting |
|-------|----------|
| Insurance office | Cold fluorescent, flat, unflattering, institutional |
| Victim's struggle | Harsh, shadowed, claustrophobic |
| Resolution/CTA | Golden hour, warm, directional, hopeful |

---

## STYLE LOCK (Add to ALL Prompts)

Append to every image generation for visual consistency:

```
STYLE LOCK SUFFIX:
cinematic color grading, desaturated with lifted blacks, 
subtle film grain, shallow depth of field,
motivated lighting, hyperrealistic detail, 9:16 vertical,
Roger Deakins atmospheric quality, documentary seriousness
```

### Nevada-Specific Modifiers

When applicable, add:
```
NEVADA LOCK:
Las Vegas suburban aesthetic, tan stucco backgrounds, 
harsh desert sunlight, palm trees, strip mall parking lot,
Nevada license plates visible, desert browns and tans
```

---

## CHARACTER CONSISTENCY WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Create Victim Reference

Generate ONE consistent victim character for the whole video:

```
NANO BANANA (fal-ai/nano-banana/pro):
Front-facing portrait of [VICTIM: 35-year-old Hispanic woman, shoulder-length 
dark hair, concerned expression, casual clothing - worn hoodie], studio lighting,
clean background, high detail face, upper body visible, reference sheet style
```

### Step 2: Generate Each Scene WITH Character

Each scene prompt must include the character description:

```
[YOUR CHARACTER DESCRIPTION copied from Step 1],
[ACTION/POSE], in [ENVIRONMENT],
[LIGHTING matching scene mood],
[CAMERA ANGLE], match reference character exactly, [STYLE LOCK]
```

### Step 3: Animate with Kling Elements

```
fal-ai/kling-video/o1/reference-to-video

Upload: Character reference image as Element1
Upload: Scene image to animate

PROMPT:
@Element1 [ACTION], [CAMERA MOVEMENT], [ENVIRONMENT], [LIGHTING], cinematic, film grain
```

### CRITICAL: Framing Match Rule

| If You Want | Your Source Image Must Be |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Walking full-body | Full-body shot with leg room |
| Talking head / reaction | Chest-up medium close-up |
| Hand gestures | Waist-up with arms visible |
| Seated | Seated in source image |

**Mismatch = Distortion.** AI compresses skeleton if framings don't align.

---

## AUDIO DESIGN

### Voiceover Approach

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Voice | `Bill` (gruff, working-class — Second Chair default) |
| Tone | Deadpan, documentary, slightly sarcastic edge |
| Pace | Measured, strategic pauses before reveals |
| Timing | 1.5-2.1 words/second (23-31 words for 15s) |

### Sound Layers

| Layer | Volume | Duration |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Voiceover | 100% | Ends ~2-3s before video end |
| Environment | 50% | Full video length |
| Music bed | 30% | Full video length |

### Music Presets

| Scene | Preset |
|-------|--------|
| Hook (power imbalance) | `urgent_tense` |
| Build (bureaucracy) | `news_underscore` |
| Payoff (resolution) | `victory_resolution` |

---

## TEXT OVERLAY SYSTEM

### Typography

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Font | Arial Bold (Instagram native) |
| Case | lowercase preferred |
| Color | White with subtle drop shadow |
| Position | Center-bottom, below chin level |
| Padding | 250px from bottom (clears Reels UI) |

### Timing Sync

| Text Length | Duration | Animation |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 1-2 words | 0.5-1.0s | Pop in |
| 3-4 words | 1.0-1.5s | Word by word |
| 5+ words | 1.5-2.5s | Phrase chunks |

**Rule**: Text appears 50-100ms BEFORE the spoken word (slight lead).

## EXAMPLE CONCEPTS

### Concept A: "The Settlement Gap" (15s)

**Theme**: Insurance adjusters lowball accident victims

| Beat | Dur | Shot | Dramatic Visual | Emotional Weight | Text |
|------|-----|------|-----------------|------------------|------|
| HOOK | 3s | God View | Exec looking at tiny victim in snow globe | Power imbalance | "the offer" |
| SETUP | 4s | Reaction CU | Victim scanning letter, jaw clenches | Betrayal | "doesn't add up" |
| BUILD | 4s | Wide Crowd | Identical adjusters typing in unison | Dehumanization | "what they owe" |
| PAY | 4s | Hero Medium | Victim in golden light, documents in hand | Hope | "check eligibility below" |

**Script (23 words)**:
"The offer they give... doesn't match the bills. But what an experienced lawyer fights for... that's what they actually owe. Link below."

---

### Concept B: "The Machine" (20s)

**Theme**: Insurance is a machine, lawyers break the machine

| Beat | Dur | Shot | Dramatic Visual | Emotional Weight | Text |
|------|-----|------|-----------------|------------------|------|
| HOOK | 3s | Wide Crowd | Endless cubicles, adjusters in grey | System as machine | "the machine" |
| SETUP | 4s | Over-Shoulder | Victim seeing "DENIED" stamp | Crushed | "runs on no" |
| BUILD | 4s | Absurdist | Rubber stamp worn smooth from overuse | Kafkaesque | "they say no" |
| TURN | 4s | Two-Shot | Lawyer stands with victim | Alliance | "to everyone" |
| PAY | 5s | Hero Medium | Victim confident, lawyer behind | Triumph | "link below" |

**Script (30 words)**:
"The claims machine runs on one word: no. They say it to everyone. Until someone shows up who speaks their language. Experienced lawyers change the answer. Check eligibility below."

---

### Concept C: "The Waiting Room" (15s)

**Theme**: Victims stuck in limbo, lawyers accelerate

| Beat | Dur | Shot | Dramatic Visual | Emotional Weight | Text |
|------|-----|------|-----------------|------------------|------|
| HOOK | 3s | Wide | Crowded waiting room, numbers on wall | Trapped | "months" |
| SETUP | 4s | Reaction CU | Victim slumped, fluorescent hell | Despair | "waiting" |
| BUILD | 4s | Command Center | Lawyer at desk, multiple files moving | Momentum | "while they work" |
| PAY | 4s | Hero | Victim leaving building, sunlight | Release | "check eligibility" |

**Script (25 words)**:
"Months in the waiting room. While bills pile up. While they stall. An experienced lawyer knows how to move things along. Check eligibility below."

*This format treats meme-culture visual execution with Oscar-bait seriousness. The subject is legal lead gen; the execution is cinema. The characters are so specific they're insights themselves. That's why it stops the scroll.*

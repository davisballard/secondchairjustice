## Creative Strategy Summary

1. **Geographic targeting gets you reach** - All 2.16M people in these zip codes
2. **Creative does the filtering** - Working-class imagery self-selects audience
3. **Three distinct creative tracks:**
   - Metro: Maria/Carlos avatars, urban/suburban, diverse
   - Northern: Rosa/Miguel avatars, rural, Spanish-heavy
   - Southern: Split between Pueblo (Joe/Linda) and Springs (Tyler/Ashley)
4. **Universal hooks:** "Cases being accepted," "No upfront cost," "Find out in 60 seconds"
5. **Platform:** Facebook primary, Instagram secondary, TikTok for younger segments

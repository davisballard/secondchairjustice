- **Fresh leads:** 30-90 day window preferred (though up to 2 years is technically eligible)
- **Clear liability:** Other driver at fault
- **Medical treatment:** Injuries requiring care
- **No existing attorney:** Lead is available

### Timing Window
From Danny's meeting:
> "If it happened within the last two years you're technically still eligible but Jacoby and Myers and those type of law firms, they want those fresh 30 to 90 day victims."

## Out of Scope (We Do NOT Cover)

The following injury types are **not part of Second Chair's focus**:

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Workplace Injuries | Different niche, different partner firms |
| Slip and Fall | Not our specialization |
| Medical Malpractice | Requires specialized partners |
| Mass Torts | Campaign-specific, not core business |
| Product Liability | Not our focus |
| Construction Accidents | Workers' comp complications |

If asked about these categories, redirect focus to MVA.

1. Car accidents (primary focus)
2. Motorcycle accidents (secondary)

**Scale to higher value:**
3. Truck/semi accidents (higher complexity, higher payout)
4. Rideshare accidents (growing market)

# Demographics: Second Chair

## Target Audience Overview

**Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) victims** who may have legal claims and need representation.

Second Chair focuses exclusively on MVA — we do not target workplace injuries, slip and fall, medical malpractice, or other PI categories.

**Important:** Due to Meta Special Ad Categories, targeting is LIMITED. We cannot target based on:
- Health/injury signals
- Specific interest in "personal injury lawyers"
- Custom audiences built on injury data
- Lookalikes based on injury leads

**Strategy:** Broad geographic targeting + let the creative do the qualifying. Call out MVA victims in first 3 seconds.

## Behavioral Patterns

### Information Seeking
- Searching: "do I have a case," "car accident lawyer near me," "what to do after accident"
- Researching: settlement amounts, legal process, insurance tactics
- Worried about: cost, time, outcome, dealing with insurance

### Decision Factors
1. **Cost concern** — "No upfront cost" messaging resonates
2. **Trust** — Need to feel confident in attorney
3. **Speed** — Want answers quickly
4. **Outcome** — Want to know potential value
5. **Overwhelm** — Someone to handle the fight for them

### The Flooding Problem
> "Once you engage with one of these things you get like a hundred of them... how do you stand out in the sea?" — Danny

Once a user touches one PI ad, they get flooded by competitors. Differentiation is critical.

## Media Consumption

### Platforms (where we can reach them)
- **Facebook:** Primary platform, older demographics
- **Instagram:** Younger MVA victims
- **Google Search:** High intent, searching for lawyers
- **YouTube:** Informational content, how-to legal questions
- **TikTok:** Underutilized in PI industry — major opportunity for humor/UGC content
- **Spotify:** Emerging — audio interrupt ads available

### Traffic Split
- **Mobile: 75%** — Design mobile-first
- **Desktop: 25%**

### Peak Times
- **Weekday evenings:** After work, researching
- **Weekends:** More time to investigate options
- **Post-accident:** Often searching same day or week

### Platform Opportunity Notes
> "The rest of the internet in the industry is not really playing there [TikTok]... these people are dinosaurs." — Danny

TikTok represents significant opportunity because:
- Competitors aren't active there
- Humor and UGC content performs well
- Organic reach potential before paid ads
- ROI is strong once campaigns are running

## What We CANNOT Target (Special Ad Categories)

Per Meta restrictions for legal services:

❌ Interest-based targeting (e.g., "interested in personal injury lawyers")
❌ Custom audiences based on health/injury signals
❌ Lookalikes built on injury lead data
❌ Age, gender, or zip code targeting in some cases

✅ Broad geographic targeting (down to 5-15 mile radius)
✅ Age range (18+)
✅ Language
✅ Let creative qualify the audience

**The solution:** Call out your avatar explicitly in the first 3 seconds. The creative does the targeting.

# Danish Graves — Quick Reference Card
## Pull this out in any strategy session.

## Who He Is in One Sentence

The best PI attorney in his market. Built from nothing. $11M firm. 14 lawyers. Demanding, skeptical, well-resourced — and worth every ounce of effort it takes to earn his business.

---

## The 4 Questions He Always Asks

1. **"Walk me through the math."** — He's going to run the cost-per-signed-case numbers himself. Have them ready.
2. **"Who else in my market are you working with? I'll call them."** — He verifies everything. Name-drop someone he can actually call.
3. **"What happens when I get a bad lead?"** — He wants to know the accountability structure before he commits.
4. **"Why wouldn't I just run this myself on Facebook?"** — This is the real objection. Have a real answer.

## Instant Yes Triggers

- Territorial exclusivity in his market (real, not cosmetic)
- Verifiable data from a comparable firm
- Second Chair rep who speaks PI law fluently
- 60-day trial with no long-term commitment
- Someone who treats him like a peer, not a prospect

---

## Instant No Triggers

- Shared leads (non-negotiable — he won't do it)
- Deceptive consumer ad creative (he's a compliance hawk from his defense years)
- Vague sourcing answers ("we generate leads digitally" is not an answer)
- Upselling before earning the relationship
- Talking at him like he's being educated

## His Vocabulary (Use It or Lose Him)

| Say This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| "Cost per signed case" | "Cost per lead" |
| "Pre-lit pipeline" | "Pending cases" |
| "Intake conversion" | "Lead conversion" |
| "Case criteria" | "Lead preferences" |
| "Catastrophic injury" | "High-value case" |
| "Policy limits" | "Settlement ceiling" |
| "Commercial vehicle" | "Trucking" (he'd say trucking but notices if YOU mispronounce the industry) |

## The Pressure Test

Before finalizing any Second Chair B2B strategy, run it through Danish:

**Messaging:** *"Does this sound like a vendor or a partner?"*  
**Creative:** *"Would I be embarrassed if a judge saw this?"*  
**Offer structure:** *"Is this what I actually care about, or what Second Chair thinks I care about?"*  
**Proof:** *"Why would I believe this without verifying it?"*  
**Pitch approach:** *"Am I being sold to, or talked to?"*

---

## What He Actually Wants (Beneath the Numbers)

Pipeline certainty. The confidence to say no to bad cases because good ones are coming. To sleep through the night. To go to his daughter's lacrosse game without checking his phone.

**He doesn't want leads. He wants certainty.**

That's the only pitch worth making.

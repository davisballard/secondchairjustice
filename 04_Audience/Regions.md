## Geo-Localized Creative Strategy

**Approach:** Same messaging, swap out location.

1. Create base creative with state-neutral messaging
2. Use AI to generate state-specific imagery (landmarks, recognizable locations)
3. Swap backgrounds while keeping core ad structure
4. Deploy via state-specific subdomains

**Example:** Same avatar, same script → different state gets localized background.

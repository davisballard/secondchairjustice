# Geo-Exclusivity Policy

> **Type:** Internal policy — not for external distribution  
> **Status:** Active  
> **Date:** February 2026

---

## The Policy

**DMA (Designated Market Area) is the standard territory unit.**

Clients are sold geo-exclusivity at the DMA level — one PI law firm per DMA. No competing firm in that DMA can become a Second Chair client while a firm holds that territory.

**No exceptions. No grandfathered arrangements. One firm, one DMA.**

---

## Current Client Roster

Second Chair is launching with zero active clients. There are no legacy arrangements, no inherited exclusivity deals, and no grandfathered exceptions to honor. Every territory is open.

## The Three Product Tiers

### Tier 1 — Standard: Per-DMA Exclusivity
One firm locks one DMA. Pricing by market size:
- **Mega** (LA, NYC, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami): $400–$500/lead
- **Large** (SF, San Diego, Tampa, Denver, Phoenix, Seattle): $350–$450/lead
- **Mid/Small/Micro** (Fresno, Bakersfield, Corpus Christi, etc.): $200–$350/lead

### Tier 2 — Bundle: Multi-DMA or Regional
For firms with multiple offices or regional reach — sell them the specific DMAs they operate in, bundled:
- 2–3 DMAs in the same state: 10% discount vs. individual DMA pricing
- All DMAs in a state: 15% discount vs. individual DMA pricing
- Each DMA must be explicitly named in the contract

### Tier 3 — Enterprise: Statewide or Multi-State (Exception Only)
For firms that genuinely run statewide campaigns and want every lead in a state — this exists but is a premium exception, not the standard:
- Priced as the sum of all DMAs in that state, minus a 10–15% bundle discount
- Never a flat per-state fee (avoids the trap of pricing large and small states identically)
- Minimum 12-month contract; annual review
- Requires explicit approval — statewide deals should be rare and deliberate

## What to Say on the Website / FAQ

Keep it vague. Do not explain the DMA model in detail publicly. Suggested language:

> "We offer territory-exclusive arrangements — per DMA, per state, or custom — depending on the nature of the deal. One firm per territory, always."

Or for an FAQ:

> "How is your exclusivity structured?"  
> "We offer flexible territory arrangements — by DMA, by state, or custom — based on the size and scope of a firm's market. Our team will walk you through what makes sense for your geography on a call."

## What to Say on Sales Calls

This is where you get specific. The discovery question that opens it:

> "Tell me about the markets you operate in. Are you running in one city, a few cities, or statewide?"

From there:
- **Single city / one DMA:** "We'd lock the [City] DMA for you. Here's what that means and what it costs."
- **Multiple cities, same state:** "We'd lock the specific DMAs where you operate. Here's the bundle pricing."
- **Statewide:** "We do offer statewide arrangements, but it's priced as the sum of the DMAs in that state. Let me show you what that looks like for [State]."

**The key distinction to name in every call:**

> "Most lead gen companies sell exclusive leads — meaning they won't sell the same contact twice. We sell exclusive territory — meaning no competing firm in your DMA can buy from us at all. Two firms in the same city can both be clients of another lead gen company. Only one can be a Second Chair client."

## Why DMA, Not MSA or ZIP or State

| Unit | Why Not Standard |
|------|-----------------|
| ZIP code | Too granular — PI firms serve full metro areas, not ZIP codes |
| County | Better, but not how attorneys think about their markets |
| MSA | More granular than DMA (382 vs. 210 nationally) but less intuitive to PI attorneys |
| State | Too broad — caps us at 50 clients nationally; blocks markets firm never serves |
| **DMA** | **How PI firms already think about and buy media (TV, radio, CTV, streaming). Published Nielsen map = unambiguous boundaries. 210 markets nationally = real scale.** |

---

## Revenue Ceiling Comparison (Why This Matters)

| Territory Unit | Max US Clients | ARR Ceiling |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Per State | 50 | $40M–$60M |
| Per DMA | 210 | $84M–$168M |
| Per MSA | 382 | $115M–$248M |

The DMA model opens the revenue ceiling to 2–3x the per-state model while keeping territory language that clients immediately understand.

## Professional Bio

Alex DuBelko is Co-Founder and Head of Product & Innovation at Second Chair, where he owns the full product stack — from website and funnel architecture to tool development, data infrastructure, and conversion optimization. His background spans 13+ years across product management, full-stack development, growth marketing, fintech, real estate, media monetization, and AI-powered tool building.

Most recently as Senior Product Manager at **TradeStation**, Alex led the 0-to-1 build of a next-generation mobile trading app (iOS & Android) achieving 99.96% crash-free sessions, a 60% increase in app store rating, and a 32% reduction in platform complaints. He owned the multi-year roadmap for TradeStation's flagship web trading platform serving high-value options/futures traders, and designed growth & activation journeys that slashed time-to-first-trade and boosted funded-to-first-trade conversion.

As founder of **Summit Analytics Consulting**, Alex ran a 6-year product practice helping founders and executives go from idea to in-market, then from PMF to scalable growth — spanning fintech, real estate, media monetization, and AI-enhanced internal tools. He owns the full product lifecycle: customer discovery, ideation, solution design, technical scoping, shipping v1, and iterating with data.

Alex is a **General Assembly full-stack web development graduate** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, PostgreSQL), a **Reforge alum** (Product Strategy, Scaling Product Delivery, Growth Series, Mastering Product Management), and **CXL-certified** in Conversion Optimization, Growth Marketing, Data Analytics, and Digital Psychology.

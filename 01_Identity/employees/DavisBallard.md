## Strategic & Creative Philosophy

Davis's approach is built on three integrated pillars:

### 1. Evidence-Based Marketing Science
Grounded in replicated research from Ehrenberg-Bass Institute (Byron Sharp's *How Brands Grow*), Binet & Field's *The Long and the Short of It*, and decades of academic marketing studies. Replicated evidence beats expert opinion.

**Key principles:**
• Growth through mental and physical availability, not loyalty
• Distinctive assets over differentiation claims
• 60/40 balance: long-term brand building + short-term activation
• Category Entry Points (CEPs) as strategic framework

### 2. Behavioral Psychology as Tactical Toolkit
Applying Richard Shotton's 25 biases, Adam Ferrier's action-focused psychology, and Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations as practical levers.

**Core biases leveraged:**
• Social proof, scarcity, distinctiveness, anchoring, framing
• Context effects and choice architecture
• Behavioral nudges and friction reduction

### 3. Alchemy — The Counterintuitive Magic
Rory Sutherland's insight: not everything that works is logical. Sometimes the "inefficient" solution creates disproportionate value.

**Application:**
• Red Bull costs more and tastes worse—that's WHY it works
• Perceived value often matters more than functional benefits
• The weird idea can outperform the optimized one

**For complete strategic approach and frameworks:** *[See personal/professional/APPROACH.md](../../../../personal/professional/APPROACH.md)*

---

## Philosophical Foundation

Davis's thinking is shaped by **Krishnamurti** (*Freedom from the Known*) and the **Tao Te Ching**—emphasizing presence, observation, and seeing clearly without conditioning. **Richard Feynman** serves as creative and intellectual model: ADHD curiosity, playfulness, rejection of pretension.

This philosophical foundation influences everything: creative work, strategic thinking, and approach to building businesses. Focus on evidence, continuous learning, and letting work speak for itself.

**For complete worldview and guiding principles:** *[See personal/core/WORLDVIEW.md](../../../../personal/core/WORLDVIEW.md)*

## Research Phase: Territory Mapping

### Prestigious Law Firm Visual Landscape

**Key Findings:**
- Leading law firms (Freshfields, Simmons & Simmons, Swift Currie) are modernizing while honoring heritage
- Trend toward **bold, dynamic** identities that reflect entrepreneurial spirit
- Emphasis on comprehensive visual systems, not just standalone logos
- Strategic messaging around collaboration, innovation, forward-thinking

**Design Priorities:**
- Modern visual systems (not static logos)
- Balance heritage with evolution
- Convey strength, leadership, expertise
- Attract both clients and top-tier talent

**Takeaway:** Elite law firms are moving toward confident modernism. We can own this space without looking traditional or stodgy.

### Personal Injury Lead Gen Competitive Landscape

**Visual Clichés to AVOID:**
- Blue/white generic trust color schemes
- Aggressive urgency (red/yellow)
- Cheap design execution
- Stock photography of accidents/injuries
- Overly literal visual metaphors

**Common Approaches:**
- Clean, modern, contemporary aesthetics
- Illustrations over photography
- Emotionally driven visual direction
- Mobile-optimized (traffic from social ads)
- Clear prominent CTAs for conversion

**Takeaway:** The category lacks premium positioning. Most lead gen looks cheap. Our opportunity is to look like a **prestigious law firm** in a category of generic lead gen.

### Scales of Justice Symbol Research

**Traditional Approaches (To Avoid):**
- Ornate classical courthouse scales
- Delicate decorative treatments
- Realistic illustration style
- Lady Justice figure integration

**Modern Geometric Approaches (Our Direction):**
- Simplified geometric forms
- Strong clean lines
- Minimalist interpretation
- Abstract balance concepts
- Letter integration possibilities

**Successful Modern Examples:**
- Clean pillar with balanced circular pans
- Architectural column representations
- Abstract equilibrium symbols
- Badge/seal containers for authority

**Takeaway:** Modern geometric scales can convey justice and balance without courthouse cliché. The key is **strong, not delicate**.

---

## Discovery Phase: Initial Explorations

### Exploration 1: Scales Symbol Concepts

**Tested 4 approaches:**
1. Geometric scales (hexagonal pans, strong pillar)
2. Abstract balance (semicircular pans on central axis)
3. Shield-scales hybrid (protection + justice)
4. Contained balance (scales in circular badge)

**Learning:** Abstract balance and contained badge approaches were strongest. Literal geometric scales felt too complex. **Badge container adds authority and premium feel.**

---

### Exploration 2: Typography Treatments

**Tested 3 type directions:**
1. Bold geometric sans (Gotham/Montserrat style) — STRONGEST
2. Professional neo-grotesque (Helvetica style) — Too generic
3. Humanist sans (Gill Sans style) — Too soft

**Learning:** Bold geometric sans conveys trust + action simultaneously. ALL CAPS treatment reinforces command/CTA nature of brand name.

---

### Exploration 3: Integration & Lockups

**Key Insights:**
- Horizontal lockup (symbol left, wordmark right) — Most versatile
- Stacked lockup (symbol top, wordmark below) — Good for square formats
- Icon-only (symbol in container) — Works for favicon/app icon

**Learning:** Need clear hierarchy and generous spacing. Symbol and wordmark should feel unified, not separate.

---

## Refinement Phase: Finding The Winner

### Badge Exploration Iterations

**Round 1: Badge Styles**
- Simple ring badge ✓
- Double ring (gold outer/navy inner) ✓✓
- Solid navy badge with reversed scales ✓✓✓ **STRONGEST**
- Split ring (dynamic openness) ✗ Too busy

**Winner:** Solid navy badge with white reversed scales  
**Why:** Highest contrast, best legibility at small sizes, strongest presence

---

### Round 2: Adding Premium Touches

**Tested:**
- Solid navy badge alone — Strong but missing premium cue
- **Solid navy badge + thin gold accent ring** — ✓✓✓ **PERFECT**
- Double ring (gold + navy) — Too decorative
- Architectural pillar base — Too busy

**Winner:** Solid navy badge with thin gold outer ring  
**Why:** Gold ring adds premium feel without losing impact. Navy for trust, gold for victory, white scales for clarity.

---

### Round 3: Scales Symbol Refinement

**Proportions tested:**
- Large scales filling badge — Too crowded
- **Medium scales with breathing room** — ✓✓✓ **IDEAL**
- Small scales — Too timid, lost at small sizes

**Details tested:**
- Circular pans — ✓ Clean and classic
- Triangular pans — Too aggressive
- Square pans — Too corporate/architectural
- Pillar with base platform — Good for stability metaphor

**Winner:** Clean pillar with balanced circular pans, medium-sized within badge

## Next Steps: Production Refinement

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Perfect proportions** — Badge size, scales size, ring thickness, spacing
2. **Refine details** — Pillar width, pan circles, balance point
3. **Test wordmark spacing** — Letter-spacing for confidence

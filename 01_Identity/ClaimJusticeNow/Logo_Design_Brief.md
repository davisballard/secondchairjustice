# ClaimJusticeNow Logo Design Brief

**Brand:** ClaimJusticeNow (Consumer-facing PI Lead Generation)  
**Designer:** Massimo Vignelli (Visual Systems Architect)  
**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Status:** Final Refinement Phase

---

## Project Overview

Design a logo and visual identity system for ClaimJusticeNow — the consumer-facing brand that connects personal injury accident victims to elite PI attorneys.

**Replacing:** Claim Justice Now (name and visual identity)

---

## Strategic Foundation

### Brand Positioning
"The first step to fighting back against insurance companies who rob people."

ClaimJusticeNow connects injured people to warrior lawyers who can take on corporate dragons.

### Core Requirement
**TRUST and QUALITY above all else.**

The brand must look like a **prestigious law firm**, never like sleazy lead generation.

---

## Target Feeling

**"I have the best warrior fighting for me"**

A combination of:
- **Trust** — They can rely on us to connect them with credible representation
- **Power** — They have access to the best legal fighters
- **Action** — The time to act is NOW

---

## What It Should NEVER Be Confused With

- ❌ A charity or government service
- ❌ An insurance company
- ❌ Sleazy lead gen / ambulance chaser
- ❌ Generic legal directory

---

## Mark Requirements

### Type
**Combination Mark** — Symbol + Wordmark
- Symbol must be distinctive for multi-exposure recognition (retargeting)
- Wordmark always present except favicon/app icon
- "Claim Justice Now" reinforces the action we want them to take

### Symbol Direction
**Scales of Justice** — representing fairness, balance, legal power

**Form Requirements:**
- STRONG (not delicate or ornamental)
- CLEAN (not clipart, not courthouse cliché)
- DISTINCTIVE (ownable, not generic)
- SCALABLE (works at favicon size and billboard)

**Current Direction:**
Solid navy blue circular badge with thin gold accent ring, containing white reversed scales of justice. Modern geometric interpretation, not traditional.

---

## Color System

### Primary: Deep Navy Blue
**Hex:** #1B3B6F

**Psychology:**
- Trust, authority, legal credibility
- Most associated with prestigious law firms
- Professional competence and stability

**Why:** Legal category standard for conveying trust and quality.

---

### Accent: Gold
**Hex:** #D4AF37

**Psychology:**
- Excellence, victory, prestige
- References scales as precious metal
- Winning and achievement

**Why:** Differentiates from standard blue legal firms, conveys premium positioning.

---

### Supporting Colors
- **Charcoal (#2C2C2C)** — Typography, power elements
- **White (#FFFFFF)** — Backgrounds, reversed applications
- **Light Gray (#F5F5F5)** — Secondary backgrounds

---

## Typography Direction

**Style:** Bold Geometric Sans-Serif (Gotham Bold or similar)

**Conveys:**
- TRUST: Established, substantial letterforms
- QUALITY: Geometric precision, professional
- ACTION: Bold weight, confident presence
- LEGAL: Professional aesthetic without being stodgy

**Treatment:** ALL CAPS — CLAIM JUSTICE NOW

---

## Logo Lockups

### 1. Horizontal (Primary)
Symbol (left) + CLAIM JUSTICE NOW wordmark (right)  
**Usage:** Most contexts, website headers, ads

### 2. Stacked
Symbol (centered top) + CLAIM JUSTICE NOW (centered below)  
**Usage:** Square formats, limited horizontal space

### 3. Icon-Only (Favicon)
Symbol in square container  
**Usage:** Favicons, app icons, social avatars, small-scale applications

---

## The Rand Diagnostic (Quality Criteria)

Every mark must pass:

✅ **Distinctive** — Stands apart from competitors  
✅ **Memorable** — Can draw from memory after one viewing  
✅ **Scalable** — Works at 16px and 16 feet  
✅ **Timeless** — Based on principles, not trends  
✅ **Versatile** — Works on light, dark, photo backgrounds  
✅ **Simple** — Can describe in one sentence  
✅ **Meaningful** — Form embodies brand values  
✅ **Ownable** — Could not belong to a competitor

---

## The Trust Check

Three critical questions:

1. **Does this look like a prestigious law firm?**
2. **Would someone trust this with their injury case?**
3. **Does it convey quality and credibility?**

All must be YES.

---

## Competitive Context

### What To Avoid (PI Lead Gen Clichés)
- Generic blue/white trust signals
- Aggressive red/yellow urgency palettes
- Cheap-looking design and stock imagery
- Overly literal accident/injury visuals

### What To Own (Our White Space)
**"Prestigious legal quality in PI lead gen"**

We sit between high-end law firms (too traditional) and typical lead gen (too cheap). Nobody else looks this professional.

---

## Applications

### Primary Uses
- Website header/logo placement
- Quiz funnel form header
- Retargeting ads (Facebook, Instagram, Google)
- Email communications
- Social media profiles

### Secondary Uses (Future)
- Business cards
- Letterhead
- Presentation materials
- Partner communications

**Note:** Website form doesn't allow logo clicks (static image only). Logo is primarily for brand recognition through multi-exposure advertising.

---

## Success Criteria

The final mark is successful when:

✅ Passes all Rand Diagnostic criteria  
✅ Passes all Trust Check questions  
✅ Looks distinctive next to 5 competitors  
✅ Works at favicon scale without losing legibility  
✅ Feels inevitable (not arbitrary)  
✅ Conveys trust + power simultaneously  
✅ Could sit alongside elite law firm identities

---

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize mark** — Select winning direction from current explorations
2. **Refine proportions** — Perfect spacing, scale, balance
3. **Create lockup variations** — Horizontal, stacked, icon-only
4. **Test at all sizes** — Favicon to billboard
5. **Vectorize for production** — Clean AI/SVG files
6. **Build asset library** — All variations, all color treatments
7. **Create usage guidelines** — Minimum sizes, clear space, do's and don'ts

> "We are not a lead generation company. We are the first step to fighting back against insurance companies and corporations that rob everyday people."

**How The Identity Delivers This:**

1. **Trust First** — Navy blue, professional execution, legal symbolism = "You can trust us"
2. **Power Second** — Bold typography, gold accents, confident scales = "We have the best fighters"
3. **Action Always** — "CLAIM JUSTICE NOW" is a directive, not a passive name
4. **Hero Connection** — Scales represent the warrior lawyers who fight for justice

**The Emotional Journey:**
- **See the mark** → Feel trust (navy, professional, clean)
- **Read the name** → Understand action (CLAIM, NOW)
- **Grasp the concept** → Feel empowered (JUSTICE, scales, fighting back)

## The Massimo Vignelli Principle

> "A logo is not communication. A logo is identification. This mark identifies ClaimJusticeNow as trustworthy, professional, and powerful. It identifies the first step in fighting back. It identifies quality in a category that often lacks it. That is its job. And it does it well."

## Service Name

**Personal Injury Demand Infrastructure**

Subtitle: "Predictable case flow for elite PI firms"

---

## What We Provide

### Core Offering

Geo-exclusive MVA lead generation with pre-qualification, real-time delivery, and intake support for personal injury law firms. Territory exclusivity is structured per DMA (Designated Market Area) as the standard — one firm per DMA. Statewide and custom arrangements are available by negotiation.

**Coverage:**
- Motor vehicle accidents (car, motorcycle, truck/semi, rideshare)
- Slip and fall
- Medical malpractice
- Product liability

**Note:** MVA is the highest-volume PI case type and the best-developed within this vertical. Other PI case types (slip and fall, med mal, product liability) are accepted but less prioritized in current creative and tooling.

## How It Works (PI-Specific)

### 1. Demand Creation (Geography-Exclusive)

We don't run generic PI ads. We build demand infrastructure within your exclusive territory — defined by DMA (Designated Market Area) as the standard. One firm per DMA. Statewide arrangements available by negotiation.

- **Agency-grade creative:** 18+ years Fortune 500 advertising experience applied to legal — campaigns that earn attention, not just interrupt
- **Behavioral targeting:** DMA-exclusive campaigns that reach the right people at the right time
- **Brand familiarity:** By the time someone needs help, they've already seen Claim Justice Now

**Emotional layer:** We're building awareness for people who need help after the worst moments of their lives—and connecting them to attorneys who can fight back against insurance companies.

### 2. Demand Capture (Qualification at Entry)

Creative quality pre-qualifies at the top of funnel — the work itself filters intent:

- **Creative as filter:** Agency-grade advertising attracts real injury victims, not tire-kickers — the quality of the work does the pre-screening
- **Behavioral qualification:** Injured in accident, not at fault, medical treatment, not represented, within statute
- **Trust before transaction:** By the time they reach your intake, they're calm, qualified, and ready

**Emotional layer:** These aren't "leads." They're people who've been hurt and need someone to fight for them. We make sure they're ready to be helped.

### 3. Demand Qualification (Risk Management)

We reject leads before you have to:

- **92% acceptance rate** — partner firms accept 92 out of 100 leads we deliver
- **Verified injuries** — medical treatment confirmed
- **Liability screening** — not-at-fault determination
- **Statute check** — within filing deadlines
- **No prior representation** — not already signed with another firm

**Rational:** Protects your margins, your time, your trust.  
**Emotional:** So you can focus on the cases that matter—people you can actually help.

### 4. Delivery (Real-Time, Exclusive)

- **Instant delivery** — leads in your inbox within seconds of qualification
- **One firm only** — no bidding wars, no shared leads
- **Qualified lead profile included** — injury type, liability indicators, treatment status
- **Transparent reporting** — bad weeks reported early, no spin

## Messaging Hooks (Rational + Emotional)

### The Unique Mechanism (Lead With This)

> **"The Creative Advantage"** — We don't buy leads. We build them.

Second Chair is led by co-founders with 18+ years of Fortune 500 advertising experience (Davis Ballard, Alex DuBelko, Sasha Zinshtein). Every campaign — every ad, every funnel, every landing page — is built at an agency level no lead gen competitor can match. The creative itself is the differentiator: better ads attract higher-intent prospects, behavioral targeting reaches real injury victims, and DMA-exclusive campaigns mean your firm owns the market.

**How to use it in conversation:**
> "Most PI lead gen is built by media buyers running the same templates in every market. We're a creative agency that happens to do lead gen — 18 years of Fortune 500 advertising experience applied to personal injury. The result is leads that convert because the creative that produced them was better."

**Important:** The Creative Advantage isn't one tactic — it's the compounding effect of superior creative, smarter targeting, and geo-exclusive campaigns working together. Every lead we deliver exists because the advertising that attracted it was better than anything else in the market.

## State-Specific Considerations

### Active Markets
- California
- Colorado
- Nevada
- Washington

### Expansion Targets
- North Carolina
- South Carolina
- Georgia
- Mississippi

### State Bar Compliance
See: [`05_Restrictions/State_Bar_Quick_Ref.md`](../05_Restrictions/State_Bar_Quick_Ref.md)

**Critical rules:**
- FCC 2025 consent requirements (one-to-one consent, named entities)
- Third-person language only (never "you" when referencing injury/condition)
- No guarantee of results
- Disclosure that we're not a law firm

---

## Creative & Campaign Infrastructure

### Claim Justice Now (Consumer-Facing Brand)

**What it is:**
> The consumer-facing brand through which all PI/MVA campaigns run. Claim Justice Now is the public identity — Second Chair is the B2B partner brand attorneys buy from.

**Strategic value:**
- Separates consumer advertising from attorney relationship
- Builds brand familiarity in exclusive DMAs before accidents happen
- Enables trust-building creative that educates and empowers injury victims
- Allows DMA-exclusive campaign deployment without competitor visibility

### The Creative Advantage (Core Differentiator)

**What it is:**
> 18+ years of Fortune 500 advertising experience (Davis Ballard, Alex DuBelko, Sasha Zinshtein) applied to PI lead generation. Agency-grade creative, behavioral targeting, and DMA-exclusive campaigns replace the template-driven, media-buy-only approach used by every other PI lead gen company.

**How it works:**
- **Creative quality as filter:** Better ads attract higher-intent, higher-quality prospects — the work itself pre-qualifies
- **Behavioral targeting:** Campaigns reach people based on behavioral signals, not just keyword bidding
- **DMA-exclusive deployment:** One firm per market means campaigns are built for that market, not recycled nationally
- **Full-funnel creative:** From awareness content through qualification funnels — every touchpoint is agency-built

---

## Competitive Differentiation (PI-Specific)

### What Other PI Lead Gen Companies Do

**Typical model:**
- Sell shared leads to 3-5 firms
- High volume, low quality
- No transparency about lead source
- Blame attorney when leads don't convert
- Generic "qualified MVA leads" positioning

**Language:**
- "Premium MVA leads"
- "Exclusive" (but not really)
- "Real-time delivery" (table stakes)

### What Second Chair Does Differently

**Our model:**
- **The Creative Advantage** — 18+ years Fortune 500 advertising experience. Agency-grade creative that pre-qualifies through quality, not gimmicks. No other PI lead gen company has real agency talent building their campaigns.
- **Full case spectrum** — soft tissue for consistency, high-value targeting (rideshare, trucking, spine/TBI, wrongful death) for upside
- Geo-exclusive (one firm per DMA, actually enforced)
- DMA-exclusive campaign deployment with behavioral targeting
- Over-qualification beats volume — we reject leads before you have to
- Transparent reporting, bad leads credited
- We help you convert (follow-up intelligence, 60-second response protocol)

**Language:**
- "The Creative Advantage" not "quality leads"
- "Agency-grade lead generation" not "we send leads"
- "Demand infrastructure" not "lead gen"
- "Elite firms" not "all attorneys"
- "Predictable case flow" not "get more leads"
- "We're on your side in the fight" not "buy our leads"

**Alternative Considered:** Case Justice Now (rejected)

---

## Strategic Rationale

### The Core Insight

"Claim Justice Now" creates a false promise — the consumer doesn't get a dollar amount estimate on the quiz funnel. They get qualified and connected to attorneys. The name misrepresents the service.

The new name needs to:
1. Accurately describe what the service provides (attorney connection)
2. Align with brand positioning ("fighting back against insurance companies")
3. Function as a call-to-action
4. Be memorable and ownable

## Why "Claim Justice Now" Wins

### **Comms Strategy (Julian Cole, Head of Strategy)**

**Mental Availability:** "Claim" functions as both a category signal (filing a claim) AND a desired action (claiming what's owed). It does double duty.

**Message Reinforcement:** When ads say "Claim your settlement," "Claim your rights," "Claim what's owed" — the brand name reinforces that messaging across every touchpoint. Different messages for different moments, but unified under the "claim" action.

**Role in Funnel:** The CTA throughout the quiz is to claim their rights/justice/settlement. The brand name becomes the master CTA.

### **Mental Availability (Byron Sharp, Brand Growth Scientist)**

**Category Entry Point:** When MVA victims are searching for help, they use the word "claim" constantly:
- "I need to file a claim"
- "My claim was denied"
- "Insurance rejected my claim"

The phrase "claim" appears 10x more frequently in victim language than "case."

**Distinctive Assets:** While "claim" is overused in the category, paired with "Justice" it creates a unique, memorable combination. Claim + Justice = distinctive positioning.

**Recall Probability:** "Claim Justice Now" links to the most common category entry point, increasing mental availability at the moment of decision.

### **Consumer Truth (Jon Steel, Narrative Strategy)**

**Natural Habitat Research:** When you talk to MVA victims in their homes (not in a facility), they use "claim" constantly. It's the language of their fight with the insurance company.

"Case" is what their lawyer calls it AFTER they've hired representation. But at the moment they're searching for help, they're thinking about their **claim**.

**The Obvious Truth:** The best names enter the conversation already happening in someone's head. They're searching for "claim help," "claim denied," "accident claim."

**Room for the Mouse:** "Claim Justice" leaves room for interpretation — claim your justice, justice through claiming. It's layered and emotional. "Case Justice" feels transactional.

### **Behavior Change (Adam Ferrier, Behavioral Strategist)**

**The Behavior Gap:**
- Current: Person has been in accident, doesn't know what to do, searches online
- Desired: Fill out quiz funnel to connect with attorney
- Barrier: Overwhelmed (ability) + unsure they deserve help (motivation)

**Action Spurs Stack:**
- **"Claim"** = action verb, reduces cognitive load (they know what to DO)
- **"Justice"** = motivational word, gives permission (this is righteous)
- **"Now"** = urgency trigger, creates immediate action

This is a **behavior-forward name**. It's a command that tells them what to do and why to do it.

"Case Justice Now" doesn't give them a clear action — "case" is a passive noun.

---

### **Creative Excellence (John Hegarty, Executive Creative Director)**

**The Zag:** Everyone in PI lead gen says "Get your case reviewed," "Build your case," "Case evaluation." If everyone's saying "case," then **"claim" is the zag.**

**Truth + Magic:**
- **Truth:** People are literally trying to claim what's owed. The insurance company denied their claim. It's the truth of their situation.
- **Magic:** "Claim Justice" turns the bureaucratic act of filing a claim into something righteous. You're not just filing paperwork — you're claiming justice. That's emotional transformation.

**Heart First:** "What the heart knows today, the head will understand tomorrow." 

"Claim Justice" hits the heart first — empowerment, action, fighting back.
"Case Justice" hits the head — logical, procedural, flat.

**Good vs. Great:** "Claim Justice Now" is great. Good is the enemy of great.

This isn't about getting an estimate. It's about **claiming justice.**

The name is:

All in three words.

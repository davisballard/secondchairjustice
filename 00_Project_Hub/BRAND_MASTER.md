## Ad Creation (Start Here)

**To create ads, just say:** "Make ads for [STATE]" (e.g., "Make ads for CA")

This triggers the **Ad Creation Workflow** (`AD_CREATION_WORKFLOW.md`) which:
1. Auto-loads all relevant context for that state
2. Assembles the full creative team (Julian, Richard, Ed, Depesh, Indigo, Giuseppe, Hegarty)
3. Runs a roundtable discussion where experts build on each other's ideas
4. Presents concepts for your approval before developing executions
5. Creates production-ready ads with image prompts

**See:** `AD_CREATION_WORKFLOW.md` for the full workflow specification.

## Brand Positioning (Updated Feb 2026)

**Start here for brand understanding**

Second Chair positioning uses a **fused approach**: rational core (from website) + emotional layer (from research).

### Quick Reference

**Rational Core (What We Do):**
- Geo-exclusive demand infrastructure for elite law firms
- One firm per DMA — territory exclusive, not just lead exclusive
- Creative Advantage — superior ad creative that outperforms commodity lead vendors
- Four-phase system: creation, capture, qualification, delivery
- Over-qualification beats volume

**Emotional Layer (Why It Matters):**
- "The rhythm that keeps a law practice alive"
- Certainty in a profession built on contingency
- Attorneys as advocates fighting resource asymmetry (David vs. Goliath)
- We're on the attorney's side in the fight against insurance companies

**How to Use:**
- **Lead with rational** in sales, website, proposals (credibility first)
- **Layer in emotional** in storytelling, brand content, retargeting (resonance)
- **Fuse both** in case studies, email campaigns, thought leadership

**See:** `BRAND_POSITIONING_CORE.md` for complete fused positioning framework

## Critical Rules (Read First)

1. **"YOU" IS BANNED** — Never use second person when referencing injury/pain/condition
2. **Third person only** — "Accident victims may be entitled..." not "Are you injured?"
3. **We are NOT a law firm** — We are a lead aggregator, disclose accordingly
4. **One-to-one consent** — FCC 2025 requires named entities, no "marketing partners" lists
5. **Special Ad Categories** — Limited targeting on Meta, no lookalikes on injury data
6. **FIRM NAMES ONLY IN 3 PLACES** — Partner firm names can ONLY appear in: (1) Form fine print, (2) Consent checkbox, (3) Thank You page header. Use their stats/testimonials in ads, but NOT the firm name.
7. **NO BLAND IMAGES** — ALL images MUST follow `10_Ad_Factory/Production_Guidelines/Image_Style_Guide.md`. Market-specific, amateur iPhone quality, 3-5 easter eggs, match the ad angle. No stock-looking AI slop.
8. **VIDEO CLIP CONTINUITY** — Same person must appear across all clips in a multi-clip video. If Clip 2 shows a man with a cast, Clip 3 must show the SAME man.
9. **SCRIPT TIMING** — Target 1.5-2.1 words per second. 15-sec video = **23-31 words**. Music/ambiance continues ~2-3 sec after VO ends.
10. **AUDIO MIX** — Voiceover 100%, Environment 50% (LOUD — must be clearly audible), Music 30%. Music + environment run FULL video duration.
11. **VOICE** — Use `Bill` (gruff, working-class American) for ads. Alternative: `Adam` (deep, mature).

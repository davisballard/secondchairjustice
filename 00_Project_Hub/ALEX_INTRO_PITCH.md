# Second Chair — The Opportunity

*A brief for Alex DuBelko*

---

## What We Are

Second Chair is a **geo-exclusive lead generation company** for personal injury law firms. We run our own ad accounts across Meta and Google, capture leads through behaviorally-optimized landing pages and quiz funnels, and sell those leads exclusively to **one partner law firm per DMA** (Designated Market Area).

One firm per metro. No shared leads. No bidding wars.

**Consumer brand:** Claim Justice Now (claimjusticenow.com)

The model: we generate high-intent PI leads through advertising that pre-qualifies before the first phone call, and we sell those leads to partner attorneys at **$400 each** (standard) or **$1,500+** (premium case-ready). Our cost to generate a lead is **$75–$150**. Every DMA partner we sign is recurring revenue — they buy leads from us month after month because the leads convert into signed cases.

We cover the full PI case spectrum: soft tissue and minor MVA ("keep the lights on" volume), plus high-value targeting — commercial trucking, rideshare, spinal injuries, wrongful death.

Lead gen is the core. But once we've built trust with attorney partners, we expand into **premium lead nurturing** (doing the intake work for them) and **agency services** (brand identity, running their ads, chatbots, email flows, websites). Three revenue streams from one relationship.

We're not a law firm. We're demand infrastructure — with an agency services layer on top.

---

## Why We Win

Legal lead gen is a category full of template-buyers. Media buyers running generic stock-image ads, competing for the same traffic, delivering the same low-intent contacts. Every company looks the same. Every lead feels the same.

Second Chair is different because of **The Creative Advantage**:

- **Agency-grade creative** — Built by a team with 18+ years across Fortune 500 brands (Disney, Google, Samsung, Vacation). Not templates — real creative that stops the scroll and triggers action.
- **Behavioral science** — Every ad, headline, and quiz question is built on behavioral psychology. We solve the psychological barriers to contacting a lawyer before the lead ever calls.
- **DMA exclusivity, actually enforced** — One firm per metro. Your market is yours. Period.
- **Quiz funnels that pre-qualify** — By the time someone completes the flow, they've self-selected as a real case with real intent. The leads arrive fired up, ready to sign.
- **Justice positioning** — "Claim Justice Now" isn't a tagline. It's the entire consumer brand. Every touchpoint reinforces advocacy and urgency in a way generic lead gen can't replicate.

The rest of the industry buys traffic and hopes. We build advertising systems.

## How I See Us Working Together

This is a shot in the dark based on your LinkedIn, but here's what jumped out.

**Your TradeStation 0-to-1 build** — You took a next-gen mobile trading app from zero to 99.96% crash-free sessions, 60% app store rating increase, 32% complaint reduction. Full FINRA/SEC compliance. That's exactly the kind of product discipline our funnel infrastructure needs. We need someone who can build consumer-facing lead capture that works at scale and doesn't break.

**Your CXL + Reforge training** — Conversion optimization, growth marketing, digital psychology, product strategy, scaling product delivery. This is the exact toolkit for what we're building: funnels that convert, quiz flows that pre-qualify, and growth mechanics that compound. You're not learning on the job — you've been trained by the best programs in the industry for exactly this kind of work.

**Your Compass analytics work** — You built custom real estate analytics dashboards using APIs with statistical modeling and pricing forecasts. We need the same thing for our partners: DMA performance dashboards, lead quality analytics for attorney partners, real-time views into what's working and what's not. And internally, market-by-market intelligence to guide our expansion.

**Your AI agent build** — You recently built a proprietary trading platform using AI agents with Claude Code. We're running our entire marketing and creative engine on AI systems. You understand what's possible when you stop treating AI as a toy and start treating it as infrastructure.

**Your Breakwater financial modeling** — DCF, sensitivity analysis, transaction modeling supporting $550M+ in fund activity. This translates directly to building ROI calculators for attorney prospects — showing them exactly what they earn per dollar spent with us. That tool alone could be a closer.

**Your Summit Analytics consulting practice** — Six years helping founders go from idea to in-market, then from PMF to scalable growth. That's what we're doing. Except this time, you're not consulting — you're building your own thing with real equity.

**The flywheel:**

1. I create the ads, scripts, brand positioning, and creative strategy
2. You build the funnels, landing pages, quiz flows, tools, and conversion optimization that capture and qualify the leads
3. Sasha buys the media that distributes the creative and closes the attorney partnerships that monetize the leads
4. Revenue splits three ways

Three domains. No overlap. One machine.

## The Unit Economics

### Standard Leads (Day 1)

| | |
|---|---|
| **We sell leads at** | $400/lead |
| **Our cost to generate** | $75 (optimized) – $150 (target) |
| **Profit per lead** | $250 – $325 |
| **Per founder, per lead** | **~$83 – ~$108** |

### Premium Case-Ready Leads (Month 4–6)

| | |
|---|---|
| **We sell leads at** | $1,500+/lead |
| **Our cost (generation + nurturing)** | $150 – $250 |
| **Profit per lead** | $1,250 – $1,350 |
| **Per founder, per lead** | **~$417 – ~$450** |

Premium leads go through a full nurturing stack before the attorney ever touches them: AI call bots for initial contact, AI chatbots for 24/7 engagement, SMS/text sequences, real human calls for high-value leads, and full intake documentation. The lead arrives at the attorney's desk **case-ready** — they just need to sign. We're doing part of the lawyer's intake job for them, and charging accordingly.

Standard leads put $83–$108 per founder per lead. Premium puts **$417–$450**. Same DMA, same partner, 4–5x the revenue per lead.

---

## What One Client in One DMA Looks Like

This is the building block. One attorney partner, one metro area. **Per-founder take-home:**

### Standard Leads ($400/lead)

| Leads/Day | At $150/Lead Cost | At $75/Lead Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **1 lead/day** | $2,500/mo — $30,000/yr | $3,250/mo — $39,000/yr |
| **2 leads/day** | $5,000/mo — $60,000/yr | $6,500/mo — $78,000/yr |
| **3 leads/day** | $7,500/mo — $90,000/yr | $9,750/mo — $117,000/yr |
| **4 leads/day** | $10,000/mo — $120,000/yr | $13,000/mo — $156,000/yr |

### Premium Case-Ready Leads ($1,500/lead) — Starting Month 4–6

| Leads/Day | Per Founder Monthly | Per Founder Annual |
|---|---|---|
| **1 lead/day** | $12,500 – $13,500 | $150,000 – $162,000 |
| **2 leads/day** | $25,000 – $27,000 | $300,000 – $324,000 |
| **3 leads/day** | $37,500 – $40,500 | $450,000 – $486,000 |
| **4 leads/day** | $50,000 – $54,000 | $600,000 – $648,000 |

Every new DMA partner we sign stacks another one of these on top. A single standard client doing 3 leads/day puts $90K–$117K/year in each founder's pocket. A single premium client at the same volume: **$450K–$486K/year per founder**.

Five premium DMAs = each of us clearing **$2.25M–$2.4M/year**. From five markets.

---

## Attorney Acquisition — Close Rate Scenarios

We acquire DMA partners through direct outreach: **10–25 firms targeted per DMA**.

**Baseline outreach: Targeting 20 DMAs/month, 15 firms per DMA = 300 reachouts/month**

Average close time: 2–4 weeks. Month 1 is pipeline building — first partners close in Month 2.

| Close Rate | New Partners/Month | After 6 Months | After 12 Months |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1% (conservative)** | 3 | 15 DMAs filled | 33 DMAs filled |
| **5% (moderate)** | 15 | 75 DMAs filled | 165 DMAs filled |
| **10% (strong)** | 30 | 150 DMAs filled | 210 DMAs (full market) |

Even at a **1% close rate** — the most conservative scenario — we're adding 3 DMA partners per month, every month. That's 3 new recurring revenue streams stacking on top of each other, compounding indefinitely.

At 5%, we fill 75 markets within 6 months. At 10%, we saturate all 210 US markets within a year.

---

## DMA Market Scale — The Big Picture

There are **210 Designated Market Areas** in the United States. Each one is a market we can own.

**Per-founder annual income at 3 leads/day per DMA:**

| DMA Fill | Active DMAs | At $150/Lead Cost | At $75/Lead Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **5%** | 11 | **$990,000/yr** | **$1,287,000/yr** |
| **10%** | 21 | **$1,890,000/yr** | **$2,457,000/yr** |
| **25%** | 53 | **$4,770,000/yr** | **$6,201,000/yr** |
| **50%** | 105 | **$9,450,000/yr** | **$12,285,000/yr** |
| **75%** | 158 | **$14,220,000/yr** | **$18,486,000/yr** |

These are **per-founder** numbers. Equal three-way split.

Filling just 5% of US markets — 11 DMAs — puts each of us near or above **$1M/year**.

At 25% fill (53 DMAs), each founder is clearing **$4.7M–$6.2M/year**. This is not fantasy math — it's unit economics multiplied by market count.

---

## Revenue Expansion — What Opens Up at Month 4–6

Lead gen is the engine. But once we've built trust with attorney partners and have the infrastructure running, two additional revenue streams come online.

### Stream 2: Premium Lead Nurturing ($1,500+/lead)

Instead of handing the attorney a raw lead from a quiz funnel, we do the intake work for them. The full nurturing stack:

- **AI call bots** — Automated initial contact within minutes of form submission
- **AI chatbots** — 24/7 engagement, answering questions, building trust
- **SMS/text sequences** — Follow-up cadences that keep the lead warm
- **Real human calls** — For high-value leads (trucking, wrongful death, severe injury)
- **Full intake documentation** — Accident details, injury info, insurance status, treatment records

The lead arrives at the attorney's desk **case-ready**. They review the file and sign. We're doing the hardest part of their job — the part where 60%+ of leads fall through the cracks because firms are too slow or too busy to follow up properly.

**Why attorneys will pay 4x more:** Speed-to-contact is the #1 predictor of case signing. Most firms take hours or days to call back. We make contact in minutes with AI, nurture through the decision window, and hand over a documented, qualified, ready-to-sign case. The attorney's conversion rate goes from ~10% to 40%+ because we've already done the work.

**Premium lead adoption ramp:**

| Timeline | % of Partners on Premium | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Month 4–6** | 10–15% | Early adopters, partners who trust us from lead quality |
| **Month 7–9** | 20–30% | Word spreads, ROI proven, case studies built |
| **Month 10–12** | 30–40% | Becomes the default for partners who've seen results |
| **Year 2+** | 40–60% | Premium is the standard offering for new partners |

### Stream 3: Agency Services for Attorney Partners

Our partners already trust us. They see our creative quality, our funnels, our results. The natural next question: *"Can you do this for our firm directly?"*

| Service | Type | Revenue | Who Delivers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Brand Identity** | One-time project | $10,000 – $25,000 | Davis |
| **Running Their Ads** | Monthly retainer | $3,000 – $5,000/mo | Davis + Sasha |
| **AI Chatbot** | Setup + monthly | $5,000 + $1,000/mo | Alex |
| **Email / Nurture Flows** | Setup + monthly | $3,000 + $1,500/mo | Davis |
| **Website Build** | One-time project | $10,000 – $20,000 | Alex |
| **Analytics Dashboard** | Setup + monthly | $5,000 + $500/mo | Alex |
| **Ad Buying / Media** | Monthly retainer | $2,000 – $4,000/mo | Sasha |

**Average partner on retainer: ~$5,000/month.** Profit margin: ~70%. Per founder: **~$1,167/month per client** on services.

This is pure upside. We're not prospecting — we're upselling existing partners who already see the value.

**Agency services adoption ramp:**

| Timeline | % of Partners Using Services | Revenue Per Client |
|---|---|---|
| **Month 4–6** | 10–15% | $5,000/mo avg retainer |
| **Month 7–12** | 20–30% | $5,000–$7,000/mo |
| **Year 2+** | 30–50% | $6,000–$10,000/mo (deeper engagements) |

### The Combined Picture — All Three Revenue Streams

Here's what it looks like when lead gen, premium nurturing, and agency services stack together. Using the **1% close rate** (most conservative) at Month 12 — 33 cumulative DMA partners, 3 leads/day:

**Assumptions:** 25% of partners on premium leads, 20% using agency services.

| Revenue Stream | Units | Per Founder Monthly | Per Founder Annual |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard leads** (25 DMAs) | 75 leads/day | $187,500 | $2,250,000 |
| **Premium leads** (8 DMAs) | 24 leads/day | $300,000 | $3,600,000 |
| **Agency services** (7 clients) | $5K/mo avg | $8,167 | $98,000 |
| **COMBINED** | | **$495,667/mo** | **$5,948,000/yr** |

**Compare to lead-gen-only at Month 12 (1% close): $247,500/mo → $2.97M/year.**

Premium leads and agency services **double** each founder's income — even at the most conservative close rate. And adoption of premium only grows from here.

### Combined Picture at Higher Close Rates

| Scenario (Month 12) | Lead-Gen Only | With Premium + Services | Uplift |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1% close (33 DMAs)** | $2.97M/yr | **$5.95M/yr** | +100% |
| **5% close (165 DMAs)** | $14.85M/yr | **$29.8M/yr** | +100% |
| **10% close (210 DMAs)** | $18.9M/yr | **$37.8M/yr** | +100% |

These are per-founder numbers. Premium leads are the multiplier. Agency services are the cherry on top.

---

## Growth Timeline — What the Ramp Looks Like

Built from the outreach math, not guesswork. Assumes 300 reachouts/month (20 DMAs targeted, 15 firms each), 2–4 week close cycle, and 3 leads/day per DMA at operating capacity.

All numbers below are **per founder**.

### At 1% Close Rate (Conservative) — 3 New Partners/Month

| Month | Cumulative DMAs | Monthly Income | Annual Run Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | 0 | $0 (pipeline building) | — |
| **2** | 3 | $22,500 – $29,250 | $270K – $351K |
| **3** | 6 | $45,000 – $58,500 | $540K – $702K |
| **6** | 15 | $112,500 – $146,250 | $1.35M – $1.76M |
| **9** | 24 | $180,000 – $234,000 | $2.16M – $2.81M |
| **12** | 33 | $247,500 – $321,750 | **$2.97M – $3.86M** |

Even the most conservative scenario — just 1% of attorneys we contact saying yes — puts each founder at a **$3M–$4M annual run rate by end of Year 1**.

### At 5% Close Rate (Moderate) — 15 New Partners/Month

| Month | Cumulative DMAs | Monthly Income | Annual Run Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2** | 15 | $112,500 – $146,250 | $1.35M – $1.76M |
| **3** | 30 | $225,000 – $292,500 | $2.7M – $3.51M |
| **6** | 75 | $562,500 – $731,250 | $6.75M – $8.78M |
| **9** | 120 | $900,000 – $1,170,000 | $10.8M – $14.04M |
| **12** | 165 | $1,237,500 – $1,608,750 | **$14.85M – $19.31M** |

At 5% close, we're at 165 DMAs by end of Year 1 — **79% of the US market** — and each founder is pulling **$1.2M–$1.6M per month**.

### At 10% Close Rate (Strong) — 30 New Partners/Month

| Month | Cumulative DMAs | Monthly Income | Annual Run Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2** | 30 | $225,000 – $292,500 | $2.7M – $3.51M |
| **3** | 60 | $450,000 – $585,000 | $5.4M – $7.02M |
| **6** | 150 | $1,125,000 – $1,462,500 | $13.5M – $17.55M |
| **8** | 210 (full market) | $1,575,000 – $2,047,500 | **$18.9M – $24.57M** |

At 10%, we **saturate all 210 US markets within 8 months**.

### How Close Rates Map to the Big Picture

**Lead gen only (standard $400 leads):**

| Close Rate | DMAs at Month 12 | DMA Fill % | Per Founder Annual Run Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1%** | 33 | 16% | $2.97M – $3.86M |
| **5%** | 165 | 79% | $14.85M – $19.31M |
| **10%** | 210 | 100% | $18.9M – $24.57M |

**All three revenue streams combined (25% premium, 20% agency services):**

| Close Rate | DMAs at Month 12 | Per Founder — Lead Gen Only | Per Founder — Combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1%** | 33 | $2.97M/yr | **$5.95M/yr** |
| **5%** | 165 | $14.85M/yr | **$29.8M/yr** |
| **10%** | 210 | $18.9M/yr | **$37.8M/yr** |

The economics compound. More partners = more premium upsells = more agency service revenue. Every DMA we fill creates three revenue opportunities.
